    "review_text": "I have been here twice and have had really good food and $T$ both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can' t even finish half of! Flip' s burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I' ve had ever. The only thing I don' t really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don' t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It' s also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don' t make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It' s also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

Although the restaurant/ bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender( Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt $T$ with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn' t see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. Vanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work( my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

At the time I got the chickpea fries, which were delicious but watch out for the fiber because I had to sit out of an entire board game. The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead( though I didn' t get any at 12 pm haha). The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously. The real topping to the experience( other than the great $T$ and the fact that they put lemons in their complimentary ice water) was that they were playing Siouxsie and the Banshees in the background!

    "review_text": "A Bit Embarrassed I' m not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my or everyone' s meal comped last night. Yes, I' m doing the Eat On $ 30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn' t want the $ 5 Mystery Monday meal( biscuits and gravy with a fried egg looked good when I saw James H.' s, Emily R.' s and Alain L.' s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway! I wanted the company and I' m so used to dining out, I couldn' t resist, I suppose!! Long story short, the $T$ was Capital B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.' s grits side and Emily R.' s fries were either forgotten( the former) or delayed and without steak sauce( the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected. . . only to find that each one had a 20% \" service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto add for\" big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar\" face\"  and we' re Yelpers, so we' re gonna tip you( oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $ 5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp n grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl. . . no one was gonna stiff them!). Still, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \" hey, bad night.\" Then. . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for freakin' ever to bring checks, and b) ( the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.' s to go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers( note: not ours) eating some of Ron' s wings at the bar with\" regulars\" ( as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud. So when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were\" nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the\" automatic 20% service charge if he' d included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to\" chat.\" I have to say. . . I' m\" a little bit embarrassed\" because I' m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it' s a gracious gesture on management' s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy. . . and that Ron didn' t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and\" agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn' t* really* care, he noted he' d worked\" 80 or 90 hours\" in the last week( ok, but you' re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy. . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge. . . and then he said\" I can see where this is going. . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\" Well, sh* t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get* me* ( us) to STHU. And then. . . how do I tip on a non dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary' s once noting how sloooow everyone' s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a\" freebie\" given my week of Eat On $ 30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly( not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a\" service charge\" and we didn' t) and while Emily\" tipped for me\" since I didn' t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought. . . \" Huh?? What just happened??\" Monday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling and still feel like I need to* digest* my most recent experience. . .",

I got the pita Shawarma($ 8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $ 14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $ 6. 50 or $ 7. They did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis.

Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant. I mean, how out of place would that be? Trays? In a restaurant? I can' t imagine. That would be like having alcohol at a bar. Too foreign a concept. Anyway. I get it isn' t the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don' t want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.",

Mission accomplished. I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. ( although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.) My first issue was with the burnt ends. I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta. this place offered them so I came. They were sub par in my opinion. They were 1. 5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides. This is not the burnt ends I know and love. Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there. Other lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can. The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked. The good food: I really enjoyed the okra. I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it' s going to be sliced and in corn meal. However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter. Very different and very tasty. We ordered some wings and they were very good. They' re smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy. However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn' t enough. The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it. On top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues. The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift. So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables. On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us. She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was. The $T$ issues really weren' t her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender. If I' m in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again. Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.",

Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor. The reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the $T$. It was remarkable. The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded. The manager also came over to apologize.

    "review_text": "I' ve always liked Flip( I' ve been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. This past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating( two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1' s mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the' Haute Dog' made it. No biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the\" Oaxaca Burger\"  ( beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you' re looking for some kick. The burger itself was well cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef. I chose their special of the day: the\" Surf and Turf\" Burger( beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \" garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries served with mayo and ketchup($ 16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn' t disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the' Oaxaca'  the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there' d be. Always a plus! We finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio\" Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there' s a muti flavor component to them as well. The $T$ was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely. My one tiny complaint/ tip regarding Flip( all locations)  the burgers are quite small hella tasty and gourmet but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?",

    "review_text": "It was the end of a long week, and I had promised my neglected boyfriend we would spend some quality time together. Our destination of choice? Ma Soba, a pan Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill. Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out. We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening. Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had\" decided what we wanted\". She took our order and left. Not that she didn' t do her job well; she was tremendously efficient. Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly. But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable. We hit a home run with our appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. My miso soup was excellent. For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll. Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston. It' s not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi. With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality. We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile. However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come. We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend' s fork made a resounding\" clank\" against it as he tried to cut into it. I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back. We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub standard fare. We left disappointed. The sushi itself was as expected, but the $T$, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied. I doubt we' ll go back.",

The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn' t taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don' t have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won' t know, but we definitely won' t be back here!
