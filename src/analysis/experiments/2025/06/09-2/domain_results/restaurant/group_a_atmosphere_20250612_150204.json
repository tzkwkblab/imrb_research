It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can' t even finish half of! Flip' s burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I' ve had ever. The only thing I don' t really like about Flip is the $T$ and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don' t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It' s also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don' t make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It' s also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

This is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don' t have one yet. To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs. There' s a small bar( with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room. The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry. We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window. We were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive. He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy. I tried the mac and $T$, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful. The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well. My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad. I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was. He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he' s from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things. I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed. It wasn' t just blue cheese I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there. I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it. He then added that pretty much everything( including said dressing) was made on site. That says a lot, if you ask me. Oh, and I' d like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass. Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels. Three cheers for a decent lemon martini. We were the only ones in the dining room tonight. Don' t get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn' t remain a secret. Get thee to Comfort. And while you' re at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese/ gorgonzola yumminess.",

    "review_text": "I' m having trouble deciding how to rate Tomatillos, because certain things were definitely five star, and other things were kinda meh. However, I have to give them props because it seems like they' re using Yelp in the right way they' re using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I' ve been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I' ve been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that' s what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $ 8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren' t, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito( I didn' t want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his. There were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn' t sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There' s nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn' t say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda\" meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren' t that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago. I will say though, that the potato and  green  chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of $T$ they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I' m kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn' t pay extra, that wasn' t really a deal breaker for me. I definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.",

I ordered the\" roll over\" two potato cakes that had a egg scramble with delicious sausage that wasn' t gross and covered in grease and then all of this was topped with your choice of a bacon gravy or a mushroom and rosemary gravy. Personally, I chose the mushroom rosemary gravy and I think that it was hands down the best gravy I had ever tried. I might has well licked the entire plate because it looked like it when I was finished. The flavors were just right and I was shocked at the lack of greasiness that usual breakfast foods come with and their perfectly prepared $T$ were done to my liking!

The restaurant is hidden behind 6th St. and is in a quiet area, contrasting with the typical douche parade on other parts of 6th. The interior is spartan but breezy and the detail is placed on the presentation and preparation of the food, which is, to me, more important than trying to make a place look fancy but serving crapy food. We had the grilled lobster cakes as an appetizer. $T$ were cooked well and the cilantro and chipotle aioli complimented them well. For dinner my girlfriend had the green chile  polenta, which she enjoyed, while I had the pepita redfish.

It was fine but I can say I' ve had better. I really liked their' bevi' station with sparkling and still water with different flavors, it was a nice touch.

The future came, but we were relaxing on Nantasket beach just beyond the Nantasket Beach Resort, a bit over 1/ 2 a mile away. Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over. Marvel' s Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order. When she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA. She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble. For herself, she got the Crab Roll $ 13. 95 Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll/ includes coleslaw. The portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling. The rest of us shared two < U + 00BC > Lb Lobster Roll $ 18. 95( Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $ 17. 95( Sweet small bellied clams prepared in our house batter/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $ 5. 50. I liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned. The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well. Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home! We enjoyed the clam chowder both the surprise and the taste of it and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes. The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there. Good, but my preference was towards the chowder. Though we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job. $T$ were generous with wet naps and packaged salt and pepper, and we had enough utensils. 3. 5 stars, rounded up for their making amends.
