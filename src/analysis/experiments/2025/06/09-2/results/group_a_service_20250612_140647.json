    "review_text": "I have been here twice and have had really good food and $T$ both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can' t even finish half of! Flip' s burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I' ve had ever. The only thing I don' t really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don' t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It' s also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don' t make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It' s also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

Although the restaurant/ bar was packed and LOUD, the bartender( Vanessa) came over within a minute. Prompt $T$ with a smile. When my boyfriend arrived a few minutes later, we didn' t see Vanessa behind the bar so we tried to flag down her male coworker. He was caught up watching the fight and it took a few minutes to get his attention which is fine. Not fine, however, is that after I ordered a beer, he stood and texted for a few minutes before getting my beer and held his arm up to shield his texting from management lol. Vanessa, however, is an excellent bartender!! As loud as it is in this place, she continually scanned the bar looking for people attempting to make eye contact with her for service. I watched her work( my boyfriend and I have thirty years of food and beverage experience between the two of us) and she was focused and productive, but most importantly, she was ATTENTIVE!

The board game selection was great, and I love that they serve mead( though I didn' t get any at 12 pm haha). The molten lava chocolate cake was so, so good. Seriously.

    "review_text": "A Bit Embarrassed I' m not exactly sure where to start with this update, other than saying that my intention was absolutely NOT to get my or everyone' s meal comped last night. Yes, I' m doing the Eat On $ 30 Challenge. Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn' t want the $ 5 Mystery Monday meal( biscuits and gravy with a fried egg looked good when I saw James H.' s, Emily R.' s and Alain L.' s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway! I wanted the company and I' m so used to dining out, I couldn' t resist, I suppose!! Long story short, the $T$ was Capital B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.' s grits side and Emily R.' s fries were either forgotten( the former) or delayed and without steak sauce( the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected. . . only to find that each one had a 20% \" service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto add for\" big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar\" face\"  and we' re Yelpers, so we' re gonna tip you( oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $ 5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp n grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl. . . no one was gonna stiff them!). Still, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \" hey, bad night.\" Then. . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for freakin' ever to bring checks, and b) ( the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.' s to go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers( note: not ours) eating some of Ron' s wings at the bar with\" regulars\" ( as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud. So when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were\" nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the\" automatic 20% service charge if he' d included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to\" chat.\" I have to say. . . I' m\" a little bit embarrassed\" because I' m not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it' s a gracious gesture on management' s part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy. . . and that Ron didn' t really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and\" agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn' t* really* care, he noted he' d worked\" 80 or 90 hours\" in the last week( ok, but you' re the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy. . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge. . . and then he said\" I can see where this is going. . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\" Well, sh* t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get* me* ( us) to STHU. And then. . . how do I tip on a non dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary' s once noting how sloooow everyone' s food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a\" freebie\" given my week of Eat On $ 30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly( not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a\" service charge\" and we didn' t) and while Emily\" tipped for me\" since I didn' t eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought. . . \" Huh?? What just happened??\" Monday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling and still feel like I need to* digest* my most recent experience. . .",

Mission accomplished. I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. ( although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.) My first issue was with the burnt ends. I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta. this place offered them so I came. They were sub par in my opinion. They were 1. 5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides. This is not the burnt ends I know and love. Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there. Other lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can. The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked. The good food: I really enjoyed the okra. I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it' s going to be sliced and in corn meal. However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter. Very different and very tasty. We ordered some wings and they were very good. They' re smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy. However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn' t enough. The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it. On top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues. The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift. So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables. On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us. She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was. The $T$ issues really weren' t her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender. If I' m in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again. Just a disappointment when I came out of the way for burnt ends that were not great.",

Both were impressive and were lightly seasoned so that you could taste the natural flavor. The reason we are giving this place 5 stars is because of the $T$. It was remarkable. The waiter accidentally spilled my water and you would have thought there was a fire by how many of the staff responded. The manager also came over to apologize.

    "review_text": "I' ve always liked Flip( I' ve been to both the Buckhead and Howell Mill locations several times over the past few years), but of the two Richard Blais conceptions Flip Burger and HD1, HD1 was my favorite; so I was quite saddened when I learned they were turning this location into a Flip. This past Sunday was my first visit since Flip Burger opened, the space is fairly identical with the exception of additional seating( two large booths on either end of the restaurant). I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1' s mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the' Haute Dog' made it. No biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the\" Oaxaca Burger\"  ( beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you' re looking for some kick. The burger itself was well cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef. I chose their special of the day: the\" Surf and Turf\" Burger( beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \" garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries served with mayo and ketchup($ 16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn' t disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the' Oaxaca'  the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there' d be. Always a plus! We finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio\" Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there' s a muti flavor component to them as well. The $T$ was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely. My one tiny complaint/ tip regarding Flip( all locations)  the burgers are quite small hella tasty and gourmet but small. Just having a burger will leave you still a bit hungry, definitely go for an app, a side and how could you resist one of their milkshakes?",

Ma Soba, a pan Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill. Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards. Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out. We were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening. Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had\" decided what we wanted\". She took our order and left. Not that she didn' t do her job well; she was tremendously efficient. Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly. But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable. We hit a home run with our appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside. My miso soup was excellent. For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll. Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston. It' s not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi. With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality. We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile. However, the biggest disappointment was yet to come. We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend' s fork made a resounding\" clank\" against it as he tried to cut into it. I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back. We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub standard fare. We left disappointed. The sushi itself was as expected, but the $T$, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied. I doubt we' ll go back.",

Everything here is excellent and it had some of the freshest seafood available. The sushi is pretty awesome, but I definitely suggest trying their oyster sampler appetizer. My favorite entree is the seared Ahi  tuna. But definitely check out their daily specials. Sometimes they get in gigantic stone crab claws. The wine selection is great and they poor stiff drinks. Always a plus. The food is pricey but it' s excellent as well as the $T$. The decor is great too. My favorite is the outdoor patio and the bar that' s plastered with oyster shells.",

We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner.... but not today! They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered. Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon, and the waitress said\" well if you need to leave you need to leave. I will get to go boxes.\" We were in shock. We asked for the owners and they weren' t in, so we ffigure that' s why the staff was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there. So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she' s going to a soccer match, run the other direction and eat somewhere else! We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work. Now we' re telling our whole company of over 4, 000 employees to stay away from it!",

I' m not sure if this location is a franchise or not, but it was just horrible. From the $T$ to the food presentation to the taste, just ew! I always order a margarita, queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad. Being that this is always my order, I' ve come to know what to expect, but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate( unsuccessfully) the chilis' recipes. The queso dip was like warm and thick. The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn' t taste good. The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something. The chicken was thick and rubbery. I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don' t have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won' t know, but we definitely won' t be back here! The chilis on I drive is much more consistent! It' s a little more of a drive, but it' s worth it.",

I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same. In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing. Very small slices of tuna( 3 pcs), salmon( 2 pcs), katsuo( 2 pcs), saba( 2 pcs) and Hamachi( 2 pcs). They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado. Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice. I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re thinking about going there.
