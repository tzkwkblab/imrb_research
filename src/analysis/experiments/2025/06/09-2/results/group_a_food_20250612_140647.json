    "review_text": "Apparently Prides Osteria had a rough summer as evidenced by the almost empty dining room at 6: 30 on a Friday night. However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. After reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the $T$ department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don' t offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato pur é e and romanesco broccoli( incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. Management also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don' t know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.",

    "review_text": "I have been here twice and have had really good $T$ and service both times. I got a burger with caramelized onions, a red wine sauce and I believe blue cheese the first time. It was excellent and just the right size for me. I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can' t even finish half of! Flip' s burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home. The second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I' ve had ever. The only thing I don' t really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don' t like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It' s also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria. The last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don' t make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients. It' s also very pricy for burgers. This is the last place on Earth I would bring kids to eat. Burger King is right down the street.",

I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co workers went to Fred' s and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on\" moving orders through the line.\" It' s basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma($ 8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $ 14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $ 6. 50 or $ 7. They did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. $T$ wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great. Service wise, I would have to give them a 2 as the wait was terrible! 20 minutes in line is crazy for only having about 10 people in line. Good food, but the prices are very high too.",

We ordered the lamb chops for our main with a side of mashed potatoes. The potatoes were sour and not as creamy as expected.

T he salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more.

Loved the variations on menu, prices were reasonable, $T$ was tasty! They were very kid friendly as I was with my active 2 year old it helps they have TVS by each booth. The ambiance very cool and sophisticated yet comfy. Bar scene was seemed fun professional and locals that were friendly having great time. We truly enjoyed our food. Loved the pulled pork sandwich and the nachos were fabulous! Will definitely come back! Our server Mark and the rest of the staff worked well together as a team! Thank you for a great time!",

    "review_text": "First: CASH ONLY! Shady stuff Second, this is in a lot of ways a classically American Chinese joint, replete with the metal teapot and Chinese zodiac placemats, but the manager' ll be quick to point out some more old school home style Chinese stuff posted on the desk. $T$ is pretty mediocre. The\" chicken velvet\" is some kind of egg concoction that everyone around us seemed to be ordering but was seriously undersalted. The dan dan noodles were cooked too al dente and they used too much vinegar. I did find the manager sweet though he was so excited to have Chinese people come. And he seemed so wistful as he stared out into the neon glow of the McDonalds opposite, hands loosely held behind his back like my old painting teacher. I suspect that he might' ve wanted this place to be so much more. And I think it could be, if they accepted credit. Seriously, it' s like a 7 minute walk one way to the closest BoA",

That is not a good sign, mussels are suppose to smell fresh like the ocean... fishy means spoiled. What happened to the mushroom risotto? Why is it not on the menu anymore? I recalled that being delicious the last time I dined here years ago. The hassle of finding and paying to park was not worth it. I hardly noticed the view being distracted by the poor quality $T$.",

    "review_text": "I am delighted to be the first to review the Wave. The Wave Restaurant opened in June 2008 in the Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World. The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40 person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent. The biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food. The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration. In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal $T$ with huge flavor frequent organic influences... and the like. Yes... I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World. This place is a massive departure from what you would expect. No fries, no fried food. But don' t think it' s all healthy in a dull way. There' s an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and... for my money... the single best margarita I have ever consumed. The fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit. I ate there 4 times in a week at Disney. Not only is the food wonderful and the bar very attainable for dinner seating, but the prices are especially fair in the theme park context. They' d be fair in any context, in any city, on any block. This place is a serious contender for best food at WDW in my 8 day stay.",

I' m no culinary expert but the $T$ is great for the value( seriously $ 5 falafel). I went on a Saturday night and it was busy but not crowded... interestingly enough they were playing some super geeky dubstep which I was fine with but I' m not sure about everyone else, haha. Decor is modern, well lit, place was clean and staff was friendly. Order was up in like 2 minutes, like, QSR fast. Plus I got a big spoonful of tzatziki sauce at no extra charge... mmmm. They also have some unique desserts like fruit tarts. A nice alternative on a Saturday night to the normal Norwood townie infested bars! :)",
