The store itself is pretty clean and organized, the $T$ are friendly( most of the time), and BEST of all is the Self Checkout this store has! Great clearance sections throughout, and great prices on everything in the store, in general( they pricematch too!).Christian , Debbie , Jen and Hanna are all very friendly, helpful, sensitive to all customer needs. Definitely one of the better Target locations in the area, and they do a GREAT job assisting customers for being such a busy store. Located directly in the Framingham Mall on Cochituate Rd/ Route 30. 4 stars.",

Not that lame bacon we are more familiar with at your conventional breakfast diner. In addition, the place was clean and the $T$ was very helpful. The butcher had several different cuts available and was knowledgable as well as friendly. I left with some cuts of pork and beef and am excited to come back!",

It' s cheap, it' s quick and it' s surprisingly good. The establishment offers a wide selection of Mexican dinners and combination specials, common in other traditional Mexican restaurants. If you' re a fan of Mexican food, especially if you' re from out of town just go here and eat. Parking isn' t bad, your seated immediately and there is always a table available. Unfortunately there can sometimes be minor communication errors with your waitresses and the $T$ so make sure to be very clear with what you want when placing your Oder.

Then 10 minutes passed, still no utensils, we asked again and a different server told us that they didn' t have any more, that they kept going missing. This went on for the rest of the time we were here. After 20 minutes of having our food the 3 of us were given one cracker. The crab was ice cold. The $T$ then avoided our table. We informed the manager and he did not seem to care. I normally would never post anything like this, but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant. I would give them a negative star if I could. The food was NOT worth the money it cost us.",

You can also challenge Harvard students to a game of Street Fighter 2 if you feel the need, but personally I like to just relax and keep the peace. The only place that rivals this is a bubble tea shop in Calgary that I walked into awkwardly while they were still under construction. They told me to come back in and gave me a free bubble tea though so they are scoring points stricly on being nice and not charging anything( I still tipped though, I' m not a scumbag.) Boston Tea Stop( clever name especially with the MBTA map on the wall) is a valuable addition to the ever diminishing Harvard Square area. Pretty soon that neighborhood will be nothing but boring chain restaurants and mediocre bars so try and support the little guys while you can. Also the staff deserves a shout out.

I can understand if the place is jamming, but it was dead in there at 8 PM. Maybe the $T$ should spend less time hanging out together behind the bar, flexing, talking about drinking and plans for later and spend some time doing their jobs. And the pizza was only fair, not the usual excellent. Not a good showing last night. It will be a long time before we return, if we do return.

Well, this I have to see.\" I took 4 friends to this restaurant and of course, I was very skeptical. We sat down and had the chips with salsa. T he salsa was spicy and tasty and I actually requested more. Our meals included Steak Tampiquena, Flautas, Original El Paso Enchiladas, The Texican dinner and of course, one of my favorite dishes, Carne Chile Colorado. I know what El Paso Chile Colorado should taste like so when I took a bite of The Texican' s Chile Colorado, my taste buds were the happiest they had been in a long time. I also tried the other plates and this is definitely the Chicano food from back in El Paso. All my guests enjoyed their meals as I did. The food tastes like grandma' s food back home. I was truly surprised and delighted. When I feel like eating a great meal from back home, you can bet I will come back here. The $T$ was friendly and knowledgeable.

They were incredibly rude and put our order in late, like 15 minutes after we ordered.

We asked for the owners and they weren' t in, so we ffigure that' s why the $T$ was so terrible today, but my group and I decided to never go back there.
