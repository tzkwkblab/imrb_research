you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then $T$ .\n- The $T$ was delicious -LRB- I had a halibut special , my husband had steak -RRB- , and the service was top-notch .\n- The $T$ is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .\n- We had a birthday party here recently and the $T$ and service was amazing .\n- The $T$ did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters ' jokes and friendliness made up for it .\n- the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh $T$ and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .\n- Best $T$ I ever had -LRB- and being Italian , that means alot -RRB- .\n- Beware of the $T$ not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth .\n- The $T$ is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious .\n- The $T$ was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !\n- Anyway , the $T$ is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- The worst excuse for $T$ I 've ever encountered .\n- I know real $T$ and this was n't it .\n- While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the $T$ was insultingly horrible .\n- We were in search of $T$ and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .\n- We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some $T$ ?\n- Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the $T$ I eat in restaurants .\n- The $T$ here was great , a treat from beginning to end .\n- This is n't your corner $T$ takeout .\n- While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better $T$ in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the $T$ .\n- We had tons of great $T$ , wine , and desserts .\n- The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the $T$ is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .\n- all the food was excellent - considering the $T$ in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .\n- No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good $T$ .\n- $T$ is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .\n- This is the pinnacle of $T$ -LRB- all fast foods in my opinion -RRB- .\n- Nothing fancy but really good $T$ with pretty reasonable price .\n- I care more about the $T$ and ambience .\n- So , for good $T$ i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .\n- The $T$ was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .\n- An excellent alternative to $T$ joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the $T$ was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Not a small feat for good $T$ in the area .\n- The $T$ is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , -LRB- WOW -RRB- you 'll need no more .\n- The $T$ is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .\n- Even if the $T$ was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ was NOT something to get worked up about .\n- Baluchi 's has solid $T$ and a nice decor at reasonable prices .\n- The place is clean , and if you like $T$ , then this is the place to be !\n- $T$ is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to $T$ and wine .\n- big and soft as well as good $T$ .\n- Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty $T$ on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .\n- The $T$ is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .\n- The $T$ 's as good as ever .\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great $T$ with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .\n- And the $T$ , well the food will keep you coming back .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their $T$ has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .\n- Once we sailed , the top-notch $T$ and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the $T$ and service are right on target .\n- I 'm no $T$ critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the $T$ is nasty , IT IS GREAT !\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- The $T$ was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .\n- Great $T$ , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our $T$ , the line reached the door .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- Not because I was pregnant , but the $T$ here is always delicious .\n- The $T$ is authentic Italian - delicious !\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- The $T$ was absolutely horrible !\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ was authentic .\n- We love the $T$ , drinks , and atmosphere !\n- We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good $T$ .\n- I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the $T$ .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar $T$ was just what we were looking for .\n- The $T$ is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .\n- This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy $T$ .\n- it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic $T$ .\n- Great $T$ and the service is incredible .\n- Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , $T$ was well-prepared and - presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of $T$ , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- Great $T$ , great drinks , nice dining atmosphere .\n- Great selection of wine , and $T$ .\n- We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the $T$ .\n- The $T$ was bland oily .\n- I must say it 's a little pricey for the $T$ because it was not as spectacular as the view .\n- Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the $T$ very well .\n- You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb $T$ at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .\n- They treated us well and the $T$ was extremely fresh and well-prepared .\n- I found the $T$ , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- The $T$ at this place is ` gourmet ' Indian cuisine .\n- For the price you pay for the $T$ here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .\n- $T$ was decent , but not great .\n- head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in $T$ , to the much overpraised -LRB- and underdeserving -RRB- baluchi 's .\n- Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the $T$ , even the people .\n- While their $T$ is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .\n- Great $T$ , great decor , great service .\n- Speedy delivers , great $T$ , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the $T$ was slightly disappointing .\n- This is one of the best $T$ places in the city .\n- The $T$ has flavor -LRB- that can be sort of surprising on the UES -RRB- , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...\n- The ambiance is minimal the $T$ is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .\n- While the $T$ was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the service was horrendous .\n- The $T$ here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .\n- You will pay a lot for the decore , but the $T$ is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .\n- The location and ambience is Ok but the $T$ is what makes up for it .\n- They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the $T$ was late because they were out of rice .\n- We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great $T$ , and the service was really good .\n- I would n't even have complained at all if the $T$ at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .\n- Service was slow had to wait to order and get $T$ although not crowded .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- The $T$ has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .\n- If you 're craving some serious $T$ and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- The $T$ was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the $T$ and the service was .\n- The $T$ was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price -LRB- including 2 drinks , $ 100/person -RRB- ...\n- The service was excellent , the $T$ was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre $T$ , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .\n- We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the $T$ .\n- sometimes i get good $T$ and ok service .\n- Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT $T$ .\n- As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night $T$ in the city .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the $T$ was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .\n- $T$ is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .\n- The $T$ here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\n- The $T$ there are sastifying .\n- The place is small and cramped but the $T$ is fantastic .\n- The service was bad , the $T$ took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- The $T$ was spicy and delicious .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n\n【グループB】\n- $T$ was very friendly .\n- The place is so cool and the $T$ is prompt and curtious .\n- The only thing more wonderful than the food -LRB- which is exceptional -RRB- is the $T$ .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- The food is great , $T$ is ok .\n- The food is very good and the $T$ is great .\n- The drinks are a saving grace , but $T$ , please , get over yourselves .\n- $T$ was slow , but the people were friendly .\n- We 've always gotten amazing $T$ and we love the food .\n- $T$ was prompt and courteous .\n- they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the $T$ was horrible .\n- BTW , the $T$ is very good .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- $T$ is fast and friendly .\n- Food and $T$ was okay .\n- Nice atmosphere , the $T$ was very pleasant and the desert was good .\n- INCREDIBLY POOR $T$ AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , $T$ was great and the food was excellent !\n- The $T$ was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .\n- The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the $T$ is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .\n- The one positive thing I can say is that the $T$ was prompt , we got seated right away and the server was very friendly .\n- The $T$ is really fast and friendly , and the value is great .\n- Great friendly $T$ , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .\n- Aside from the rushed $T$ , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .\n- The food was good , the $T$ prompt , and the price very reasonable .\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and $T$ could have been a lot better .\n- everything is scrumptious , from the excellent $T$ by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere .\n- And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and $T$ !\n- $T$ was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .\n- The $T$ is bad .\n- Disappointing food , lousy $T$ .\n- $T$ was quick .\n- I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful $T$ .\n- Horrible food and Horrible $T$ .\n- He offers subpar $T$ and has no personality .\n- they bring $T$ up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration .\n- $T$ was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .\n- The food really is n't very good and the $T$ is terrible .\n- Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly $T$ .\n- Besides , when you have bad $T$ , that 's less money you have to tip .\n- The food was great and the $T$ was even better .\n- They have very quick $T$ which is great when you do n't have much time .\n- I was highly disappointed by their $T$ and food .\n- $T$ here was great , food was fantastic .\n- The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the $T$ or the atmosphere .\n- The $T$ was superb , they treat you like family .\n- For the people who want great food plus great $T$ , Roxy is a place to AVOID !\n- I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst $T$ experience at a restaurant ever .\n- Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the $T$ must definitely be part of the reason .\n- The $T$ is fantastic .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- The sushi has been from average to below average , the $T$ has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating -LRB- if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud -RRB- .\n- I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good $T$ and a wonderful wine list .\n- The $T$ was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .\n- Satay is one of those favorite haunts on Washington where the $T$ and food is always on the money .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- Rao 's has the best $T$ and atmosphere in NYC .\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and $T$ overcompensate .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly $T$ , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n- Go to Volare for 1st class $T$ and terrific food .\n- The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the $T$ is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- They have it all -- great price , food , and $T$ .\n- The $T$ was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- The food is top notch , the $T$ is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the $T$ was .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .\n- Yet paired with such rude $T$ , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there .\n- Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and $T$ is fast .\n- sometimes i get good food and ok $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .\n- The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the $T$ is professional and friendly .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- The $T$ is ok but could be better .\n- The $T$ is good and the resturant is clean .\n- The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for $T$ , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- The $T$ was outstanding .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad $T$ .\n- The $T$ was excellent and the food was delicious .\n- How can hope to stay in business with $T$ like this ?\n- The $T$ , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food -LRB- horrible bartenders -RRB- , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters -LRB- this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff -RRB- getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .\n- The $T$ was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- Great food , great prices , great $T$ .\n- Good $T$ , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !\n- I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the $T$ and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\n- Other than the crappy $T$ from two individuals , it 's great .\n- Overall , this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the $T$ is excellent .\n- The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the $T$ professional wan warm .\n- If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent $T$ , this is the place .\n- Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the $T$ , which was boarderline rude .\n- $T$ was prompt , friendly and great .\n- The $T$ is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view .\n- The portions are very large and the $T$ is fantastic !!\n- Tiny restaurant with very fast $T$ .\n- However , the $T$ is absolutely horrible .\n- Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French $T$ as well .\n- Great Indian food and the $T$ is incredible .\n- Although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent food -LRB- the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty -RRB- and attentive $T$ .\n- The $T$ is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .\n- Great food but the $T$ was dreadful !\n- From the terrible $T$ , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .\n- The $T$ is awful -- the last time I was there -LRB- and I do mean the last time -RRB- we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .\n- THE $T$ IS PERFECT TOO NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT\n- The food was well prepared and the $T$ impecable .\n- Everything is always cooked to perfection , the $T$ is excellent , the decor cool and understated .\n- Great food , great decor , great $T$ .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad $T$ , sometimes i get good good and bad service .\n- We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and $T$ .\n- I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the $T$ and the great staff at La Lanterna .\n- The $T$ is descent even when this small place is packed .\n- The $T$ was friendly and the atmosphere was casual .\n- I recieved prompt $T$ with a smile .\n- The $T$ is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .\n- The $T$ is pretty good .\n- Finally , I got sick of the bad $T$ , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .\n- $T$ was good and food is wonderful .\n- the $T$ is prompt friendly .\n- The $T$ was typical short-order , dinner type .\n- We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the $T$ was really good .\n- Bottom line : B + for the food , F for the $T$ .\n- Not only is the cuisine the best around , the $T$ has always been attentive and charming .\n- We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the $T$ was very quick and professional .\n- The $T$ was excellent - friendly and attentive .\n- Ive been here a bunch of times now and the $T$ is always outstanding .\n- $T$ is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .\n- However , the food and $T$ and dramatically lacking .\n- The price is reasonable although the $T$ is poor .\n- Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best $T$ you will find in even the largest of restaurants .\n- Ambience is delightful , $T$ impeccable .\n- The food , drinks and $T$ are clearly among the best in the city .\n- The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and $T$ was poor .\n- The $T$ , however , was a bright flower in a garden .\n- The food was outstanding and the $T$ was tops .\n- Found $T$ above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .\n- The $T$ was attentive , yet discreet .\n- $T$ is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .\n- The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of $T$ and food .\n- Turned out there was full $T$ upstairs and sat down .\n- A very inviting restaurant , with friendly $T$ .\n- The $T$ is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .\n- $T$ was good and so was the atmosphere .\n- The $T$ was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .\n- Speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly $T$ combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- The $T$ is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- While the food was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the $T$ was horrendous .\n- The wine the $T$ was very good too .\n- The food was below average , the $T$ was pathetic , there was no ambience at all .\n- Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude $T$ to deliver below average food .\n- This place is classy , chic , the $T$ is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .\n- Fast $T$ .\n- $T$ is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .\n- The $T$ was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .\n- Great $T$ , great food .\n- The $T$ was excellent and the food was delicious .\n- We had a birthday party here recently and the food and $T$ was amazing .\n- And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of $T$ - delivery is their Achilles ' heel .\n- Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and $T$ .\n- $T$ could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -LRB- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -RRB- in the restaurant experience .\n- Decor is nice though $T$ can be spotty .\n- The $T$ was on point - what else you would expect from a Ritz ?\n- The appetizers are ok , but the $T$ is slow .\n- The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible $T$ that made me vow never to go back .\n- The $T$ was great , and they have a whole great deal for birthdays .\n- We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the $T$ was slow .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the $T$ impecible , and the food magnificant .\n- Slow $T$ , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?\n- The $T$ is excellent and always informative without an air .\n- Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw $T$ .\n- The $T$ is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .\n- Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great $T$ .\n- $T$ is great too .\n- The $T$ is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .\n- $T$ was among the best I have ever had in NYC .\n- An excellent $T$\n- The $T$ was very attentive and very generous .\n- The $T$ was the only thing good about this restaurant .\n- I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic $T$ .\n- The $T$ is not consistently excellent -- just decent .\n- But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the price of the food is really cheap for the $T$ you get .\n- $T$ is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the $T$ is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .\n- Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , food was well-prepared and - presented and the $T$ was pleasant and prompt .\n- If presentation and $T$ is your thing , then this magic show works .\n- The $T$ was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent $T$ , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- $T$ is great , takeout is good too .\n- The $T$ is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .\n- I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL -LRB- OR BAD $T$ -RRB- @ PIGALLE .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest $T$ and often free desserts .\n- While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service -LRB- waiter was not quite competent and SLOW $T$ -RRB- and lack of remorse .\n- good music , great food , speedy $T$ affordable prices .\n- I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly $T$ to a 15 person party .\n- A con was the slow $T$ .\n- $T$ was excellent , and the AC worked very well too -LRB- thank God , it was hot ! -RRB- .\n- mojitos and the $T$ are the best part in there\n- We actually gave 10 % tip -LRB- which we have never done despite mediocre food and $T$ -RRB- , because we felt totally ripped off .\n- We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and $T$ .\n- The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the $T$ is great .\n- Add to that great $T$ and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- It 's really also the $T$ , is good and the waiters are friendly .\n- It 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer $T$ has been deemed not of the essence .\n- The $T$ was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star $T$ featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters -
