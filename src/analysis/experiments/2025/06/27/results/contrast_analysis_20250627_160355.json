very disappointing experience .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n\n【グループB】\n- The $T$ greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .\n- Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and $T$ .\n- There 's $T$ and music .\n- Great food , great lay out and awesome $T$ .\n- the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge $T$ , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .\n- However , if you want great $T$ at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .\n- Aside from the rushed $T$ , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow $T$ and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- Upon entering , we were greeted by the $T$ , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .\n- Their $T$ is to die for .\n- After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the $T$ was supposed to taste like .\n- then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the $T$ for additional people .\n- At the end you 're left with a mild $T$ that you can slurp out of a cup .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - $T$ - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Try the Pad Se-Ew or $T$ for a memorable and repeatable experience .\n- The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only $T$ that 's really good .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Sake collection was excellent -LRB- Try $T$ -RRB- , but pricy .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of $T$ overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- The $T$ were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .\n- The service was excellent and the $T$ was delicious .\n- I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the $T$ is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .\n- The $T$ is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- The $T$ was actually aweful .\n- If you love seafood , you would love this $T$ !\n- Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their $T$ .\n- It 's charmingly small and that leads to an $T$ that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .\n- my picks : Guizhou chicken , $T$ , fish fillet in spicy source -LRB- special menu -RRB- .\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- I ordered the $T$ and it was off flavor .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ however was very good .\n- Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his $T$ , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- Yes , they use fancy $T$ , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\n- The $T$ came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch !!!!!\n- We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , $T$ , and service .\n- The $T$ were pretty good .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- This $T$ is the most Japanese it can ever get .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- They have a very good $T$ and good tuna as well .\n- The $T$ , however , was a bright flower in a garden .\n- The food was mediocre and the $T$ was severely slow .\n- Great $T$ , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- They have authentic $T$ at amazin prices .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- When he finally did , he was unable to make a $T$ -- could n't find tonic .\n- A narrow corridor leads to a tiny $T$ where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess -LRB- stacks of bottles , cans -RRB- and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The menu is great , with a good $T$ , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the $T$ is more than alive .\n- The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the $T$ is out of this world !\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the $T$ and service could have been a lot better .\n- Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the $T$ was ridiculously small .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in $T$ , taste , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Nothing better than buying a $T$ for $ 3.25 too .\n- Great romantic $T$ for a date -LRB- try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! -RRB- .\n- Excellent $T$ for only $ 6.95 .\n- The $T$ is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The $T$ is always fresh too .\n- The $T$ was so-so .\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the $T$ is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Other guests enjoyed $T$ , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .\n- Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' $T$ experience .\n- The $T$ and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .\n- The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no $T$ at all .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n- love the $T$ .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy $T$ from the dumpling menu .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the $T$ .\n- Best of all is the warm $T$ , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\n- Drawbacks : $T$ is slow and they do n't toast !\n- The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the $T$ was very friendly .\n- The $T$ was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- We had $T$ at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .\n- They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the $T$ is consistent .\n- The $T$ was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .\n- If it is n't for the food -LRB- A + + + -RRB- , it must be the $T$ or the ambience .\n- The $T$ is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , $T$ , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the $T$ , and a good bottle of wine .\n- If you like $T$ get the chicken vindaloo .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Aside from the $T$ , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the $T$ magnificant .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- The food is great , I love their dumplings , $T$ , chicken and shrimp dishs .\n- A great choice at any $T$ and a great deal .\n- This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , $T$ , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- my picks are : - $T$ -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the $T$ was practically empty .\n- The $T$ was sweet and luscious .\n- You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful $T$ .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table -LRB- even though we had $T$ -RRB- .\n- From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious $T$ , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- The $T$ is courteous and friendly .\n- The $T$ is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .\n- We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the $T$ was wonderful .\n- Authentic food and they have REAL $T$ , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the $T$ .\n- It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded $T$ at dinnertime .\n- At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and $T$ are uncomfortably close .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the $T$ was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .\n- The $T$ are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\n- My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the $T$ was not very flavorful .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- And the $T$ was outragous .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the $T$ were !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland $T$ - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- The $T$ is great and authentic .\n- Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the $T$ you pay for them .\n- The $T$ and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming $T$ filled with candles and family pictures .\n- As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to $T$ .\n- Not only was the $T$ fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the duck !\n- The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the $T$ were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -LRB- not iceberg -RRB- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and $T$ could have been a lot better .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome $T$ and Hibiscus lemonade .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- The $T$ itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .\n- The only friendly $T$ was the guy at the bar .\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ - all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- This is such a lovely , peaceful $T$ to eat outside .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- The food is great -LRB- big $T$ , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- My host asked for appetizers for the group and the $T$ gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- It is kinda nosiy and the $T$ are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the $T$ , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- My entree of $T$ was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .\n- I love the drinks , esp $T$ , and the food is also VERY good .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have $T$ , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the $T$ were awesome !\n- Good $T$ and good cream cheese .\n- I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of $T$ .\n- Good service , great food , good value , and never have to $T$ in line !\n- And , atlhough $T$ opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- They have $T$ made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .\n- The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the $T$ is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting $T$ and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the $T$ .\n- Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , $T$ , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...\n- Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour $T$ place anyways ?\n- I have reservations about
