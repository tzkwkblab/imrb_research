$T$ , but terrible delivery .\n- Although small , it has beautiful ambience , excellent $T$ -LRB- the catfish is delicious - if ya do n't mind it a lil salty -RRB- and attentive service .\n- No $T$ snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good food .\n- Simple healthy unglamorous $T$ cheap .\n- The food was great - sushi was good , but the $T$ amazed us .\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and $T$ are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .\n- To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the $T$ , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .\n- We were very surprised by how good the $T$ was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- Bottom line : B + for the $T$ , F for the service .\n- I had been a regular due to the consistently good $T$ and ease of getting a table .\n- The $T$ was boring and expensive .\n- So much more than the usual $T$ , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .\n- Simple $T$ and what hot and lage portions .\n- Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the $T$ was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there .\n- Our $T$ was great too !\n- The $T$ is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring .\n- While we thoroughly enjoyed the $T$ , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .\n- Horrible $T$ and Horrible service .\n- I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the $T$ , as well the staff was freindly and knowledgable .\n- The $T$ was exceptional .\n- We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the $T$ .\n- For the $T$ , a little too expensive .\n- The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the $T$ , which is not good

week for my birthday and I could n't believe the $T$ .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the $T$ was excellent !\n- The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular $T$ , nothing special .\n- The $T$ really is n't very good and the service is terrible .\n- Service and $T$ is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The $T$ sublime for the most part .\n- Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of $T$ you get for FOUR DOLLARS .\n- Our waiter was fine , the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your $T$ .\n- If you like seafood and/or $T$ you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .\n- For some reason , all the $T$ on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .\n- The staff makes you feel at home , the $T$ is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !\n- The $T$ is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .\n- Straight-forward , no surprises , very decent $T$ .\n- The $T$ was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .\n- -LRB- $T$ was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- It is about $T$ and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .\n- Our waiter was helpful and charming , the $T$ was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- The $T$ rule .\n- The $T$ at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !\n- The $T$ is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .\n- The $T$ is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .\n- Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill $T$ .\n- good $T$ good wine that 's it .\n- Great $T$ at reasonable prices .\n- not the $T$ , not the ambiance , not the service , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .\n- The $T$ was mediocre and the service was severely slow .\n- The $T$ is nothing like its menu description .\n- If your favorite $T$ is General Tao chicken , then this is NOT your place .\n- In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the $T$ was horrible .\n- The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the

eat !\n- This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the $T$ and service was excellent .\n- Fabulous service , fantastic $T$ , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .\n- It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my $T$ .\n- It was pleasantly uncrowded , the service was delightful , the garden adorable , the $T$ -LRB- from appetizers to entrees -RRB- was delectable .\n- For authentic $T$ , look no further than Toons .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then $T$ .\n- The $T$ was delicious -LRB- I had a halibut special , my husband had steak -RRB- , and the service was top-notch .\n- The $T$ is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .\n- We had a birthday party here recently and the $T$ and service was amazing .\n- The $T$ did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters ' jokes and friendliness made up for it .\n- the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh $T$ and huge steaks , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .\n- Best $T$ I ever had -LRB- and being Italian , that means alot -RRB- .\n- Beware of the $T$ not unless you want to call the fire department to douse the flames in your mouth .\n- The $T$ is wonderful , artfully done and simply delicious .\n- The $T$ was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !\n- Anyway , the $T$ is good , the price is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- The worst excuse for $T$ I 've ever encountered .\n- I know real $T$ and this was n't it .\n- While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way , the $T$ was insultingly horrible .\n- We were in search of $T$ and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .\n- We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some $T$ ?\n- Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the $T$ I eat in restaurants .\n- The $T$ here was great , a treat from beginning to end .\n- This is n't your corner $T$ takeout .\n- While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better $T$ in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the $T$ .\n- We had tons of great $T$ , wine , and desserts .\n- The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the $T$ is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .\n- all the food was excellent - considering the $T$ in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .\n- No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good $T$ .\n- $T$ is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .\n- This is the pinnacle of $T$ -LRB- all fast foods in my opinion -RRB- .\n- Nothing fancy but really good $T$ with pretty reasonable price .\n- I care more about the $T$ and ambience .\n- So , for good $T$ i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .\n- The $T$ was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .\n- An excellent alternative to $T$ joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the $T$ was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Not a small feat for good $T$ in the area .\n- The $T$ is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , -LRB- WOW -RRB- you 'll need no more .\n- The $T$ is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .\n- Even if the $T$ was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ was NOT something to get worked up about .\n- Baluchi 's has solid $T$ and a nice decor at reasonable prices .\n- The place is clean , and if you like $T$ , then this is the place to be !\n- $T$ is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to $T$ and wine .\n- big and soft as well as good $T$ .\n- Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty $T$ on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .\n- The $T$ is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .\n- The $T$ 's as good as ever .\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great $T$ with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .\n- And the $T$ , well the food will keep you coming back .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their $T$ has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .\n- Once we sailed , the top-notch $T$ and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the $T$ and service are right on target .\n- I 'm no $T$ critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the $T$ is nasty , IT IS GREAT !\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- The $T$ was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .\n- Great $T$ , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our $T$ , the line reached the door .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- Not because I was pregnant , but the $T$ here is always delicious .\n- The $T$ is authentic Italian - delicious !\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- The $T$ was absolutely horrible !\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ was authentic .\n- We love the $T$ , drinks , and atmosphere !\n- We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good $T$ .\n- I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the $T$ .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar $T$ was just what we were looking for .\n- The $T$ is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .\n- This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy $T$ .\n- it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic $T$ .\n- Great $T$ and the service is incredible .\n- Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , $T$ was well-prepared and - presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of $T$ , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- Great $T$ , great drinks , nice dining atmosphere .\n- Great selection of wine , and $T$ .\n- We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the $T$ .\n- The $T$ was bland oily .\n- I must say it 's a little pricey for the $T$ because it was not as spectacular as the view .\n- Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the $T$ very well .\n- You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb $T$ at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .\n- They treated us well and the $T$ was extremely fresh and well-prepared .\n- I found the $T$ , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- The $T$ at this place is ` gourmet ' Indian cuisine .\n- For the price you pay for the $T$ here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .\n- $T$ was decent , but not great .\n- head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in $T$ , to the much overpraised -LRB- and underdeserving -RRB- baluchi 's .\n- Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the $T$ , even the people .\n- While their $T$ is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .\n- Great $T$ , great decor , great service .\n- Speedy delivers , great $T$ , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the $T$ was slightly disappointing .\n- This is one of the best $T$ places in the city .\n- The $T$ has flavor -LRB- that can be sort of surprising on the UES -RRB- , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...\n- The ambiance is minimal the $T$ is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .\n- While the $T$ was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the service was horrendous .\n- The $T$ here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .\n- You will pay a lot for the decore , but the $T$ is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .\n- The location and ambience is Ok but the $T$ is what makes up for it .\n- They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the $T$ was late because they were out of rice .\n- We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great $T$ , and the service was really good .\n- I would n't even have complained at all if the $T$ at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .\n- Service was slow had to wait to order and get $T$ although not crowded .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- The $T$ has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .\n- If you 're craving some serious $T$ and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- The $T$ was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the $T$ and the service was .\n- The $T$ was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price -LRB- including 2 drinks , $ 100/person -RRB- ...\n- The service was excellent , the $T$ was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre $T$ , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .\n- We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the $T$ .\n- sometimes i get good $T$ and ok service .\n- Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT $T$ .\n- As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night $T$ in the city .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the $T$ was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .\n- $T$ is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .\n- The $T$ here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\n- The $T$ there are sastifying .\n- The place is small and cramped but the $T$ is fantastic .\n- The service was bad , the $T$ took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- The $T$ was spicy and delicious .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n\n【グループB】\n- They showed up 15 minutes after the $T$ melt .\n- The $T$ should not be overlooked !\n- Anyway , the food is good , the $T$ is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- The $T$ is an asbolute steal .\n- All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the $T$ was delicious !!!\n- The $T$ is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions .\n- Ask for the $T$ .\n- We had a wonderful $T$ at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .\n- Cool $T$ but such a let down .\n- Best things to order are from the $T$ -LRB- Churrasco and Ribs -RRB- .\n- I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the $T$ give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .\n- The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough -LRB- both in $T$ AND quality -RRB- .\n- I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got $T$ .\n- My gf 's $T$ was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .\n- This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for $T$ .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , $T$ , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .\n- It took half an hour to get our $T$ , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !\n- $T$ is good as well .\n- Service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the $T$ .\n- The appetizers are ok , but the $T$ is slow .\n- We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two $T$ , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .\n- When we were finally seated our $T$ came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check .\n- Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern $T$ , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .\n- So if you want a nice , enjoyable $T$ at Montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe .\n- Great food -LRB- spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry -RRB- , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky $T$ .\n- When my $T$ came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .\n- The wine is always good , the $T$ are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy $T$ with good pizza .\n- I ate clams oreganta and spectacular $T$ .\n- We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our $T$ there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Huge $T$ , great and attentive service , and pretty good prices .\n- $T$ is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .\n- The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a $T$ , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .\n- the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no $T$ ?\n- I have n't eat a $T$ as delicious as that , the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential diners -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the $T$ .\n- I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the $T$ did n't have my name .\n- Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy -LRB- and the beautiful $T$ of course -RRB- and the food was surprising good !\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , $T$ , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw $T$ .\n- Then , get ripped on free $T$ .\n- Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this $T$ .\n- I had their $T$ for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .\n- It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty $T$ , but standing up was n't too bad .\n- If you 're looking for a great $T$ at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !\n- Great food , great $T$ , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !\n- The $T$ is incredibly helpful and attentive .\n- My Chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean , Jap style hamburger steak , $T$ , black cod with miso base , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few .\n- VT is what $T$ hope to be when they grow up .\n- I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the $T$ !\n- I

glass of wine .\n- The service , wine selection , $T$ are all outstanding and deserve recognition .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and $T$ , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Over price , and small $T$ .\n- My husband had the mesclun , $T$ , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .\n- Your $T$ could easily be better spent elsewhere -LRB- Anywhere -RRB- .\n- Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of $T$ .\n- The $T$ was n't for us , though .\n- The price was extremely reasonable for the $T$ and food we ate .\n- Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the $T$

beatiful .\n- The $T$ was excellent - friendly and attentive .\n- I was highly disappointed by their $T$ and food .\n- Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the $T$ .\n- rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $ 5 and add on a refreshing $T$ for $ 2 and you 're set for the night !\n- The $T$ suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .\n- The $T$ are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the $T$ .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good $T$ , Francois , and good service .\n- $T$ is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .\n- Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and $T$ for $ 6.25 .\n- The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the $T$ was awesome , great appetizer to share !\n- The only disappointment was the $T$ who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively

we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked $T$ in unexpected ways .\n- The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with $T$ and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick $T$ , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- Young neighborhood trendies graze at the $T$ during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .\n- Here 's to the fake $T$ too ...\n- Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' $T$ experience .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The crust is thin , the $T$ are fresh and the staff is friendly .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the $T$ , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread ,

menu and make excelent recomendations .\n- The $T$ is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied .\n- Mizu is home to creative and unique $T$ not to found anywhere else .\n- I could have drank 4 $T$ and still been parched - so watch out .\n- From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine

For authentic $T$ , look no further than Toons .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a

more appreciation for ambience then $T$ .\n- The $T$ was delicious -LRB- I had a halibut special , my husband had steak -RRB- , and the service was top-notch .\n- The $T$ is uniformly exceptional ,

pretty place in that overly cute French way , the $T$ was insultingly horrible .\n- We were in search of $T$ and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .\n- We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some $T$ ?\n- Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the $T$ I eat in restaurants .\n- The $T$ here was great , a treat from beginning to end .\n- This is n't your corner $T$ takeout .\n- While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better $T$ in that range , and so Sapphire ,

of $T$ -LRB- all fast foods in my opinion -RRB- .\n- Nothing fancy but really good $T$ with pretty reasonable price .\n- I care more about the $T$ and ambience .\n- So , for good $T$ i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .\n- The $T$ was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .\n- An excellent alternative to $T$ joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the $T$ was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Not a small feat for good $T$ in the area .\n- The $T$ is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , -LRB- WOW -RRB- you 'll need no more .\n- The $T$ is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .\n- Even if the $T$ was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ was NOT something to get worked up about .\n- Baluchi 's has solid $T$ and a nice decor at reasonable prices .\n- The place is clean , and if you like $T$ , then this is the place to be !\n- $T$ is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to $T$ and wine .\n- big and soft as well as good $T$ .\n- Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty $T$ on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .\n- The $T$ is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .\n- The $T$ 's as good as ever .\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great $T$ with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .\n- And the $T$ , well the food will keep you coming back .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their $T$ has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .\n- Once we sailed , the top-notch $T$ and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the $T$ and service are right on target .\n- I 'm no $T$ critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the $T$ is nasty , IT IS GREAT !\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- The $T$ was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .\n- Great $T$ , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our $T$ , the line reached the door .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- Not because I was pregnant , but the $T$ here is always delicious .\n- The $T$ is authentic Italian - delicious !\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- The $T$ was absolutely horrible !\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ was authentic .\n- We love the $T$ , drinks , and atmosphere !\n- We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good $T$ .\n- I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the $T$ .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar $T$ was just what we were looking for .\n- The $T$ is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .\n- This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy $T$ .\n- it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic $T$ .\n- Great $T$ and the service is incredible .\n- Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , $T$ was well-prepared and - presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of $T$ , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- Great $T$ , great drinks , nice dining atmosphere .\n- Great selection of wine , and $T$ .\n- We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the $T$ .\n- The $T$ was bland oily .\n- I must say it 's a little pricey for the $T$ because it was not as spectacular as the view .\n- Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the $T$ very well .\n- You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb $T$ at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .\n- They treated us well and the $T$ was extremely fresh and well-prepared .\n- I found the $T$ , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- The $T$ at this place is ` gourmet ' Indian cuisine .\n- For the price you pay for the $T$ here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .\n- $T$ was decent , but not great .\n- head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in $T$ , to the much overpraised -LRB- and underdeserving -RRB- baluchi 's .\n- Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the $T$ , even the people .\n- While their $T$ is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .\n- Great $T$ , great decor , great service .\n- Speedy delivers , great $T$ , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the $T$ was slightly disappointing .\n- This is one of the best $T$ places in the city .\n- The $T$ has flavor -LRB- that can be sort of surprising on the UES -RRB- , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...\n- The ambiance is minimal the $T$ is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .\n- While the $T$ was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the service was horrendous .\n- The $T$ here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .\n- You will pay a lot for the decore , but the $T$ is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .\n- The location and ambience is Ok but the $T$ is what makes up for it .\n- They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the $T$ was late because they were out of rice .\n- We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great $T$ , and the service was really good .\n- I would n't even have complained at all if the $T$ at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .\n- Service was slow had to wait to order and get $T$ although not crowded .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- The $T$ has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .\n- If you 're craving some serious $T$ and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- The $T$ was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the $T$ and the service was .\n- The $T$ was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price -LRB- including 2 drinks , $ 100/person -RRB- ...\n- The service was excellent , the $T$ was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre $T$ , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .\n- We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the $T$ .\n- sometimes i get good $T$ and ok service .\n- Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT $T$ .\n- As a long-time patron of Mamoun 's , I always figured that I had found the best late night $T$ in the city .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the $T$ was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .\n- $T$ is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .\n- The $T$ here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\n- The $T$ there are sastifying .\n- The place is small and cramped but the $T$ is fantastic .\n- The service was bad , the $T$ took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- The $T$ was spicy and delicious .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n\n【グループB】\n- They showed up 15 minutes after the $T$ melt .\n- The $T$ should not be overlooked !\n- Anyway , the food is good , the $T$ is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- The $T$ is an asbolute steal .\n- All the appetizers and salads were fabulous , the steak was mouth watering and the $T$ was delicious !!!\n- The $T$ is extensive , well priced and covers alot of regions .\n- Ask for the $T$ .\n- We had a wonderful $T$ at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC .\n- Cool $T$ but such a let down .\n- Best things to order are from the $T$ -LRB- Churrasco and Ribs -RRB- .\n- I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the $T$ give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .\n- The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough -LRB- both in $T$ AND quality -RRB- .\n- I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got $T$ .\n- My gf 's $T$ was very solid as well , although i have little base of reference .\n- This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for $T$ .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , $T$ , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .\n- It took half an hour to get our $T$ , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !\n- $T$ is good as well .\n- Service is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the $T$ .\n- The appetizers are ok , but the $T$ is slow .\n- We a menu that rearely changes , e xcept for one or two $T$ , the quality and care they put in thier food in evident .\n- When we were finally seated our $T$ came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check .\n- Haru serves very fresh fish , has a trendy , modern $T$ , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .\n- So if you want a nice , enjoyable $T$ at Montparnasse , go early for the pre-theater prix-fixe .\n- Great food -LRB- spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry -RRB- , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky $T$ .\n- When my $T$ came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .\n- The wine is always good , the $T$ are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy $T$ with good pizza .\n- I ate clams oreganta and spectacular $T$ .\n- We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our $T$ there , sharing a large Pelligrino , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Huge $T$ , great and attentive service , and pretty good prices .\n- $T$ is ok even though sometimes there 's alot of people .\n- The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a $T$ , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .\n- the restaurant was completely empty , but she gave me a dirty look and asked , no $T$ ?\n- I have n't eat a $T$ as delicious as that , the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgnin olive oil .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential diners -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the $T$ .\n- I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the $T$ did n't have my name .\n- Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced , the atmosphere is filled with energy -LRB- and the beautiful $T$ of course -RRB- and the food was surprising good !\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , $T$ , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Friendly and informative staff , very attentive and prompt raw $T$ .\n- Then , get ripped on free $T$ .\n- Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this $T$ .\n- I had their $T$ for brunch , which were the worst in my entire life , I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was .\n- It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty $T$ , but standing up was n't too bad .\n- If you 're looking for a great $T$ at a decent price , go to Del Frisco 's !\n- Great food , great $T$ , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !\n- The $T$ is incredibly helpful and attentive .\n- My Chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean , Jap style hamburger steak , $T$ , black cod with miso base , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few .\n- VT is what $T$ hope to be when they grow up .\n- I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the $T$ !\n- I 'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the $T$ !\n- good $T$ to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .\n- The service , wine selection , $T$ are all outstanding and deserve recognition .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and $T$ , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Over price , and small $T$ .\n- My husband had the mesclun , $T$ , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .\n- Your $T$ could easily be better spent elsewhere -LRB- Anywhere -RRB- .\n- Have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful , despite the fact they are often busy with lots of $T$ .\n- The $T$ was n't for us , though .\n- The price was extremely reasonable for the $T$ and food we ate .\n- Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the $T$ that comes floating along at similar venues .\n- Whether your choose the $T$ or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .\n- I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL -LRB- OR BAD $T$ -RRB- @ PIGALLE .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the $T$ of the meat -RRB- .\n- The appetizers are just OK and the $T$ were decidedly subpar .\n- The $T$ greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .\n- The food was extremely tasty , creatively presented and the $T$ excellent .\n- The steak is good , the $T$ is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .\n- Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good $T$ .\n- My $T$ was not cooked at all , my friends salmon was completely raw .\n- yourself a favor and have $T$ here and see if you dont agree with me .\n- I had the $T$ and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .\n- The $T$ was excellent - friendly and attentive .\n- I was highly disappointed by their $T$ and food .\n- Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the $T$ .\n- rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $ 5 and add on a refreshing $T$ for $ 2 and you 're set for the night !\n- The $T$ suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food .\n- The $T$ are very friendly and helpful and if you frequent they will remember you .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the $T$ .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good $T$ , Francois , and good service .\n- $T$ is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .\n- Half a chicken with a mountain of rice and $T$ for $ 6.25 .\n- The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the $T$ was awesome , great appetizer to share !\n- The only disappointment was the $T$ who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night -LRB- for the coat check girls -RRB- .\n- Service is excellent , no $T$ , and you get a lot for the price .\n- I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked $T$ in unexpected ways .\n- The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with $T$ and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick $T$ , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- Young neighborhood trendies graze at the $T$ during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .\n- Here 's to the fake $T$ too ...\n- Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' $T$ experience .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The crust is thin , the $T$ are fresh and the staff is friendly .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the $T$ , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the $T$ are unbeliavably good .\n- The $T$ is very kind and well trained , they 're fast , they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks , they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations .\n- The $T$ is always fresh and yummy and the menu is pretty varied .\n- Mizu is home to creative and unique $T$ not to found anywhere else .\n- I could have drank 4 $T$ and still been parched - so watch out .\n- From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a $T$ that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .\n- I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this $T$ accomplishes without fats .\n- It 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer $T$ has been deemed not of the essence .\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- If you are here as a $T$ , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .\n- The food is tasty and $T$ are appropriate .\n- We were so happy with our food and were even more thrilled when we saw the $T$ .\n- The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable $T$ and tables , but the service could have been better .\n- they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small $T$ for our celebration .\n- The restuarant itself is not large , but seems to have several $T$ to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese .\n- Get the $T$ of gari .\n- I have been here a few times for dinner , once for brunch and twice for $T$ .\n- You get the sense that the $T$ there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice .\n- Pizza - the only $T$ in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !\n- All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite $T$ restaurants in the city .\n- Not to be overlooked , the $T$ is excellent .\n- The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable $T$ -LRB- if bought by the pound -RRB- .\n- Well , this $T$ is so Ghetto its not even funny .\n- night without a $T$ , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- Got $T$ .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much $T$ , and all of it delicious .\n- Only wine and beer are $T$ , but the house varities are actually quite good .\n- They never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for $T$ , and threw our dishes on the table .\n- The $T$ are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .\n- at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the $T$ playing in the background is also voluminous .\n- The $T$ was extremely friendly and pleasant .\n- i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the $T$ .\n- Very romantic fires - I 've literally spent hours at Lanterna , drinking $T$ from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience .\n- Terrible , terrible $T$ - deserves to be shut-down .\n- The $T$ is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- The skillfully chosen Portuguese cheese cart paired with quality $T$ provides the perfect Iberian ending .\n- The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the $T$ were quite good .\n- Average to good Thai food , but terrible $T$ .\n- Thius is a must for anyone who loves $T$ .\n- $T$ are organic which is a real plus for me .\n- I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude $T$ .\n- Small servings for main entree , i had salmon -LRB- wasnt impressed -RRB- girlfriend had $T$ , it was good .\n- $T$ are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good .\n- Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one $T$ .\n- $T$ and Hostess was quite rude .\n- The $T$ very reasonable .\n- While there 's a decent menu , it should n't take ten minutes to get your $T$ and 45 for a dessert pizza .\n- Check out the $T$ .\n- The $T$ and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .\n- We did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of $T$ .\n- then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 $T$ on either end of the table for additional people .\n- The bar is very well stocked with interesting $T$ and well priced wines .\n- Great food -LRB- $T$ and massamman curry -RRB- , very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom .\n- I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little $T$ .\n- The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a $T$ was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked flavor .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the $T$ .\n- The $T$ were only so-so .\n- So , a little inconsistency there but either way , both $T$ were really good .\n- The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible $T$ .\n- Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite $T$ .\n- Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow $T$ experience .\n- Friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your $T$ and the company you 're with .\n- The only fallback on this restaurant is the $T$ .\n- We began with the $T$ -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and kielbasa to dip .\n- When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice $T$ as well as very good food .\n- Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great $T$ .\n- I liked the food at this $T$ restaurant .\n- Certainly not the best sushi in New York , however , it is always fresh , and the $T$ is very clean , sterile .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and $T$ overcompensate .\n- The $T$ is truly amazing here .\n- The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and $T$ and they do n't skimp .\n- Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good $T$ .\n- $T$ is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !\n- Good $T$ , combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was awful !\n- I was n't thrilled to have to $T$ on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .\n- Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and $T$ .\n- Dug the $T$ too .\n- Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a $T$ .\n- $T$ was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .\n- The $T$ and ambiance was really romantic .\n- First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my $T$ ...\n- A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and $T$ .\n- The $T$ here are a bit larger than I 'm used to .\n- I would definitely recommend SEA if you like $T$ !\n- Decent wine at reasonable $T$ .\n- The $T$ is excellent and always informative without an air .\n- THE BANANA PUDDING THEY SERVE HAS NEVER SEEN AN OVEN , THE $T$ ARE WAY OVER SALTED AND DO N'T GET ME STARTED ON THE VERY GREASY MAC AND CHEESE .\n- We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent $T$ , which was generous , I feel .\n- I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a $T$ prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !\n- for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito -LRB- or $T$ -RRB- , margarita , and dessert .\n- Overall , not worth the $T$ .\n- The $T$ offers impeccable service .\n- Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the $T$ was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .\n- The highlight of the night was the $T$ for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .\n- Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- A Thai restaurant out of rice during $T$ ?\n- Try the spicy wontons and the $T$ .\n- All conveniently $T$ right to the door .\n- I think the $T$ is good .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome $T$ and Hibiscus lemonade .\n- Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with $T$ bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !\n- I was pretty much full after our $T$ .\n- After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have $T$ .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- Best things to order are from the grill -LRB- $T$ and Ribs -RRB- .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of $T$ and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- My suggestion is to $T$ because you 'll want to try the other dishes .\n- The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the $T$ .\n- An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion -LRB- and $T$ 's precise execution -RRB- is most

For authentic $T$ , look no further than Toons .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then $T$ .\n- The $T$ was delicious -LRB- I had a halibut special , my husband had steak -RRB- , and the service was top-notch .\n- The $T$ is uniformly exceptional ,

pretty place in that overly cute French way , the $T$ was insultingly horrible .\n- We were in search of $T$ and stumbled on this block of Indian restaurants on East Sixth Street .\n- We were on our way back to NJ , and since I am in NY , we figured why not grab some $T$ ?\n- Since I cook for a living , I 'm very fussy about the $T$ I eat in restaurants .\n- The $T$ here was great , a treat from beginning to end .\n- This is n't your corner $T$ takeout .\n- While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better $T$ in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- This is literally a hot spot when it comes to the $T$ .\n- We had tons of great $T$ , wine , and desserts .\n- The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the $T$ is

slightly more pricey and well worth it .\n- No food snobs allowed , this place is for people who appreciate good $T$ .\n- $T$ is excellent quality for a good restaurant price .\n- This is the pinnacle of $T$ -LRB- all fast foods in my opinion -RRB- .\n- Nothing fancy but really good $T$ with pretty reasonable price .\n- I care more about the $T$ and ambience .\n- So , for good $T$ i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .\n- The $T$ was excellent - authentic Italian cuisine made absolutely fresh .\n- An excellent alternative to $T$ joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip , and the $T$ was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Not a small feat for good $T$ in the area .\n- The $T$ is spectacular , from the appitizers to the main course , and then of course the desserts , -LRB- WOW -RRB- you 'll need no more .\n- The $T$ is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .\n- Even if the $T$ was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ was NOT something to get worked up about .\n- Baluchi 's has solid $T$ and a nice decor at reasonable prices .\n- The place is clean , and if you like $T$ , then this is the place to be !\n- $T$ is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the staff here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to $T$ and wine .\n- big and soft as well as good $T$ .\n- Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty $T$ on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .\n- The $T$ is surprisingly good , and the decor is nice .\n- The $T$ 's as good as ever .\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great $T$ with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .\n- And the $T$ , well the food will keep you coming back .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their $T$ has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .\n- Once we sailed , the top-notch $T$ and live entertainment sold us on a unforgettable evening .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the $T$ and service are right on target .\n- I 'm no $T$ critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the $T$ is nasty , IT IS GREAT !\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- The $T$ was very good and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many vegan options .\n- Great $T$ , great waitstaff , great atmosphere , and best of all GREAT beer !\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our $T$ , the line reached the door .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- Not because I was pregnant , but the $T$ here is always delicious .\n- The $T$ is authentic Italian - delicious !\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- The $T$ was absolutely horrible !\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ was authentic .\n- We love the $T$ , drinks , and atmosphere !\n- We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good $T$ .\n- I really loved the different and inovated touch that 's the cheff gives to the $T$ .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar $T$ was just what we were looking for .\n- The $T$ is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .\n- This place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy $T$ .\n- it 's the only place you can get yummy authentic $T$ .\n- Great $T$ and the service is incredible .\n- Had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint , $T$ was well-prepared and - presented and the service was pleasant and prompt .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of $T$ , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- Great $T$ , great drinks , nice dining atmosphere .\n- Great selection of wine , and $T$ .\n- We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the $T$ .\n- The $T$ was bland oily .\n- I must say it 's a little pricey for the $T$ because it was not as spectacular as the view .\n- Decor is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the $T$ very well .\n- You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb $T$ at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .\n- They treated us well and the $T$ was extremely fresh and well-prepared .\n- I found the $T$ , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- The $T$ at this place is ` gourmet ' Indian cuisine .\n- For the price you pay for the $T$ here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .\n- $T$ was decent , but not great .\n- head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st , taj mahal is also very comparable , in $T$ , to the much overpraised -LRB- and underdeserving -RRB- baluchi 's .\n- Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the $T$ , even the people .\n- While their $T$ is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .\n- Great $T$ , great decor , great service .\n- Speedy delivers , great $T$ , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the $T$ was slightly disappointing .\n- This is one of the best $T$ places in the city .\n- The $T$ has flavor -LRB- that can be sort of surprising on the UES -RRB- , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...\n- The ambiance is minimal the $T$ is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .\n- While the $T$ was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the service was horrendous .\n- The $T$ here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .\n- You will pay a lot for the decore , but the $T$ is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .\n- The location and ambience is Ok but the $T$ is what makes up for it .\n- They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the $T$ was late because they were out of rice .\n- We been there and we really enjoy

was slow had to wait to order and get $T$ although not crowded .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- The $T$ has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .\n- If you 're craving some serious $T$ and desire a cozy ambiance , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- The $T$ was great - sushi was good , but the cooked food amazed us .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the $T$ and the service was .\n- The $T$ was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price -LRB- including 2 drinks , $ 100/person -RRB- ...\n- The service was excellent , the $T$ was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre $T$ , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .\n- We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the $T$ .\n- sometimes i get good $T$ and ok service .\n- Instead of wasting your time here : SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT CARE ABOUT $T$ .\n- As a long-time

.\n- The food is very good and the $T$ is great .\n- Not to be overlooked , the $T$ is excellent .\n- We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the $T$ was slow .\n- Haru

understood they were busy .\n- not the food , not the ambiance , not the $T$ , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .\n- For the people who want great food plus great $T$ , Roxy is a place to AVOID !\n- Good $T$ , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !\n- It 's a shame that

.\n- Food and $T$ was okay .\n- If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good $T$ , definitely visit Curry Leaf .\n- The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the $T$ is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .\n- A very inviting restaurant , with friendly $T$ .\n- And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and $T$ !\n- Great food , good size menu , great $T$ and an unpretensious setting .\n- Good , fast $T$ .\n- This place is classy , chic , the $T$ is warm

that ambience !\n- There is no excuse for such lousy $T$ !\n- I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL -LRB- OR BAD $T$ -RRB- @ PIGALLE .\n- The $T$ was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .\n- The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the $T$ or the atmosphere .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and $T$ overcompensate .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the $T$ is great .\n- I 've never had bad $T$ and the fish is fresh and delicious .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- While the food was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the $T$ was horrendous .\n- they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the $T$ was horrible .\n- The $T$ was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\n- A con was the slow $T$ .\n- $T$ could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -LRB- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -RRB- in the restaurant experience .\n- Horrible food and Horrible $T$ .\n- Turned out there was full $T$ upstairs and sat down .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and $T$ are right on target .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent $T$ , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .\n\n【グループB】\n- Ive asked a $T$ for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and $T$ and ar food was just what we were looking for .\n- Once for $T$ and once for brunch .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and $T$ .\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- Good , because hey , it 's more $T$ , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .\n- Try the $T$ -LRB- not on menu -RRB- .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ is so cheap and the waiters are nice .\n- The main draw of this place is the $T$ .\n- Highly recommend this as great value for excellent $T$ and service .\n- The wine and $T$ plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .\n- The $T$ had a nice selection .\n- The only weird thing was if we got a $T$ , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable $T$ , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE $T$ .\n- We went here for $T$ a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .\n- The $T$ were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- I liked the food at this $T$ restaurant .\n- The $T$ is average and the prices are anything but .\n- The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with $T$ .\n- The food was great - sushi was good , but the $T$ amazed us .\n- The best thing I tasted were the $T$ .\n- $T$ came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .\n- The $T$ was absolutely amazing !!\n- I never had an $T$ before so I gave it a shot .\n- We began with the $T$ -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and kielbasa to dip .\n- Dug the $T$ too .\n- From beginning appetizers , the $T$ were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- do n't get me wrong - $T$ was good , just not fantastic .\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our $T$ and each other .\n- The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other $T$ , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -LRB- avocado shrimp -RRB- were quite good .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring $T$ or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the $T$ sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !\n- For the $T$ , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The $T$ are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .\n- The waiters are sweet , the $T$ is tasty and the bill is never too large .\n- We wo n't go to this place again for a good $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the $T$ intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- Some $T$ get their wish .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- The $T$ is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out $T$ and environment .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced $T$ with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- $T$ tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .\n- I choose to go with one of the $T$ , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .\n- Even better , they know how to cook French classics like $T$ and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .\n- Good $T$ at the restaurant -LRB- a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date -RRB- .\n- The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the $T$ were stale .\n- The $T$ 's - watered down .\n- Haru serves very fresh $T$ , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .\n- $T$ was n't anything spectacular for the price .\n- The $T$ has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .\n- Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good $T$ at a fair price .\n- The duck confit is always amazing and the $T$ was out of this world .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- This place has realy fresh $T$ and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .\n- To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the $T$ offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .\n- The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the $T$ is lovely .\n- I have been here a few times for dinner , once for $T$ and twice for lunch .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- $T$ was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .\n- After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have $T$ .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous $T$ is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\n- Whenever you need a $T$ , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .\n- The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the $T$ to any food allergies or food you do n't like .\n- We were so happy with our $T$ and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .\n- $T$ was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- I 've never had bad service and the $T$ is fresh and delicious .\n- The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for $T$ and even less for lunch .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my $T$ .\n- $T$ - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?\n- Anyway , the $T$ was fake .\n- Here you get the $T$ without feeling rigid .\n- Although be warned their $T$ and take out prices are different .\n- Our $T$ was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the $T$ was not what I had hoped for .\n- The $T$ are very large and the service is fantastic !!\n- I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the $T$ -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was wonderful and imaginative .\n- If you love $T$ and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !\n- The bread is the soft paratha bread -LRB- unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta -RRB- , and the $T$ is tandoori styled and very flavorful .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- I had $T$ it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .\n- THE $T$ ARE REALLY LARGE .\n- The $T$ is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the $T$ .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- Great $T$ experience .\n- $T$ are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .\n- $T$ are rude bit again it 's new york !\n- I found the variety of the $T$ to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- The $T$ is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !\n- Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the $T$ is simply GREAT .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential $T$ -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- the food - not worth the $T$ .\n- The $T$ are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .\n- $T$ were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .\n- Our waiter was helpful and charming , the $T$ was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- From the complimentary $T$ of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .\n- their $T$ are fantastic .\n- First walking in the place seemed to have great $T$ .\n- The $T$ at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !\n- Best things to order are from the grill -LRB- Churrasco and $T$ -RRB- .\n- With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the $T$ here was decent , not great .\n- at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the $T$ playing in the background is also voluminous .\n- I think I 've had some the best $T$ of my life at minnow .\n- A Thai restaurant out of $T$ during dinner ?\n- The last time I went we were seated at a $T$ in a corridor next to the kitchen .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however $T$ or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- $T$ is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .\n- Quite frankly , this is some of the worst $T$ I have ever tried .\n- Too bad the $T$ was n't of the same heritage .\n- $T$ are the perfect size for those hungry nights .\n- We ordered a $T$ and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like $T$ or a side .\n- Reasonable $T$ .\n- I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent $T$ experience .\n- I also recommend the $T$ or the different varieties of congee -LRB- rice porridge -RRB- .\n- The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold $T$ to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- The main course had an average $T$ , and was decent overall .\n- First the wrong $T$ came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...\n- The service was friendly and the $T$ was casual .\n- Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty $T$ guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .\n- The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the $T$ is great .\n- Also , specify if you like your $T$ spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential diners -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating $T$ of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Succulent $T$ cooked precisely to your desired ` doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .\n- Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour $T$ , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?\n- We even had a visit from the $T$ who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .\n- The $T$ give you some sample slices of your order while you wait -LRB- shortly I might add -RRB- .\n- But they do n't have a $T$ , which is strange .\n- Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this $T$ , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly $T$ wine that was n't as good .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the $T$ of the meat -RRB- .\n- Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the $T$ is great .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- Great $T$ at reasonable prices .\n- They are $T$ with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .\n- Build a $T$ with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .\n- BE CAREFUL before you request extra $T$ .\n- The first time I went , and was completely taken by the $T$ and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .\n- I love to visit Murrays for my $T$ fix .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers

the cod and $T$ for dinner .\n- $T$ was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -LRB- though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -RRB- .\n- The worst excuse for $T$ I 've ever encountered .\n- I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu -LRB- $ 19.95 for $T$ , steak frites , creme brulee -RRB- and it was marvelous .\n- I would n't even have complained at all if the $T$ at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .\n- But the main hit was the $T$ .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Service was good and so was the $T$ .\n- We always enjoy the $T$ .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- His wife Tanya , the $T$ , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .\n- In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful $T$ that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .\n- We arrived for $T$ expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !\n- Do n't go alone -- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with $T$ and a selection of meats and seafoods .\n- The $T$ are ok , but the service is slow .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked $T$ .\n- The $T$ is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .\n- The second you walk through the heavy vault like $T$ , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin

better .\n- Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for $T$ , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .\n- If I could rate the $T$ this place would be off the charts -

vegetables raw .\n- I 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the $T$ .\n- Fresh , authentic , $T$ in substantial portions .\n- but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free $T$ -LRB- nice non-sushi selection -RRB- .\n- The $T$ is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , $T$ , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the $T$ , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- We could have made a $T$ of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .\n- The $T$ was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .\n- the $T$ - not worth the price .\n- Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some $T$ lover 's brunch .\n- This particular location certainly uses substandard $T$ .\n- You should pass on the $T$ .\n- To my right , the $T$ stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .\n- If you like seafood and/or $T$ you will love this place though it is not limited to

same $T$ that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .\n- I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good $T$ .\n- For the $T$ , a little too expensive .\n- Food was good and the $T$ of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .\n- The closest that I got was the $T$ , but they were out of it that day .\n- Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not $T$ on them .\n- I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine $T$ , even with no idea how to use them .\n- Great $T$ and great cocktail menu .\n- $T$ drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .\n- He takes real pride in his $T$ and his business .\n- I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got $T$ .\n- Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though - too much avocado and $T$ will fill you up right quick .\n- It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic $T$ .\n- We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added $T$ and kielbasa to dip .\n- Very nice touch that very much fits the $T$ .\n- The $T$ from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Way too much money for such a terrible $T$ .\n- I have to say I have never had a disapointing $T$ here .\n- We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large $T$ , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .\n- good $T$ to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .\n- MY date and I both ordered the $T$ and both felt the fish was very average .\n- Note that they do not serve $T$ , you must bring your own .\n- This is a consistently great place to $T$ for lunch or dinner .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a $T$ , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- delicious simple food in nice outdoor $T$ .\n- For $T$ I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .\n- The spicy $T$ is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of $T$ and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I choose to go with one of the special , the $T$ , which was excellent .\n- Definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the $T$ .\n- My host asked for $T$ for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and $T$ to dip .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- The food is all-around good , with the $T$ usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level .\n- Of course this $T$ is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?\n- The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the $T$ they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .\n- The $T$ was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 .\n- I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice $T$ .\n- Besides having the $T$ we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served -LRB- and that order was undercooked -RRB- , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .\n- I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE $T$ .\n- The $T$ was even better !\n- This big draw is the all you can $T$ here for $ 19.95 !\n- I particularly love their $T$ and their mussel selection .\n- In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave $T$ .\n- If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality $T$ , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\n- You must try the $T$ .\n- This is some really good , inexpensive $T$ .\n- They are served on $T$ and are to die for .\n- Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and $T$ which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- The place itself is beautiful the $T$ seems to be happening .\n- The $T$ was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .\n- but their $T$ was YUMMY !\n- They smell

ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .\n- Sweet Irish $T$ is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .\n- Anyway , the food is good , the $T$ is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- The food was excellent - authentic $T$ made absolutely fresh .\n- If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar $T$ then you 'll love it here .\n- My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the $T$ were the best he has had .\n- After all that , they complained to me about the small $T$ .\n- Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and $T$ .\n- Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh $T$ and great portions all at a reasonable price .\n- Any if you have a $T$ you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar .\n- Overall A oh ya even though there is $T$ it is deff worth it\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an $T$ -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the $T$ , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- If you 're in the neighborhood , definitely stop by for a great $T$ .\n- A beautiful $T$ , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .\n- My suggestion is to $T$ because you 'll want to try the other dishes .\n- Sandwiches , $T$ and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes .\n- Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the $T$ is a great value .\n- The $T$ is vibrant and eye-pleasing

$T$ was way too sweet .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the $T$ or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Friendly and informative $T$ , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .\n- The $T$ is very cool and chill ...\n- Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the $T$ .\n- Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or $T$ to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .\n- All in all the $T$ was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .\n- Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years , now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best $T$ ... Hanx\n- The staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my $T$ once when I dropped it outside .\n- They do $T$ to American palates , but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige !\n- The $T$ is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .\n- $T$ are very friendly .\n- The ambience was so fun , and the $T$ were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .\n- The $T$ we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .\n- stick with the chicken , beef , and $T$ .\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and $T$ overcompensate .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the $T$ is great .\n- I 've never had bad $T$ and the fish is fresh and delicious .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- While the food was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the $T$ was horrendous .\n- they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the $T$ was horrible .\n- The $T$ was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\n- A con was the slow $T$ .\n- $T$ could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -LRB- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -RRB- in the restaurant experience .\n- Horrible food and Horrible $T$ .\n- Turned out there was full $T$ upstairs and sat down .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and $T$ are right on target .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent $T$ , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .\n\n【グループB】\n- Ive asked a $T$ for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and $T$ and ar food was just what we were looking for .\n- Once for $T$ and once for brunch .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and $T$ .\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- Good , because hey , it 's more $T$ , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .\n- Try the $T$ -LRB- not on menu -RRB- .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ is so cheap and the waiters are nice .\n- The main draw of this place is the $T$ .\n- Highly recommend this as great value for excellent $T$ and service .\n- The wine and $T$ plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .\n- The $T$ had a nice selection .\n- The only weird thing was if we got a $T$ , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable $T$ , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE $T$ .\n- We went here for $T$ a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .\n- The $T$ were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- I liked the food at this $T$ restaurant .\n- The $T$ is average and the prices are anything but .\n- The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with $T$ .\n- The food was great - sushi was good , but the $T$ amazed us .\n- The best thing I tasted were the $T$ .\n- $T$ came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .\n- The $T$ was absolutely amazing !!\n- I never had an $T$ before so I gave it a shot .\n- We began with the $T$ -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and kielbasa to dip .\n- Dug the $T$ too .\n- From beginning appetizers , the $T$ were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- do n't get me wrong - $T$ was good , just not fantastic .\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our $T$ and each other .\n- The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other $T$ , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -LRB- avocado shrimp -RRB- were quite good .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring $T$ or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the $T$ sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !\n- For the $T$ , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The $T$ are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .\n- The waiters are sweet , the $T$ is tasty and the bill is never too large .\n- We wo n't go to this place again for a good $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the $T$ intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- Some $T$ get their wish .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- The $T$ is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out $T$ and environment .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced $T$ with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- $T$ tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .\n- I choose to go with one of the $T$ , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .\n- Even better , they know how to cook French classics like $T$ and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .\n- Good $T$ at the restaurant -LRB- a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date -RRB- .\n- The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the $T$ were stale .\n- The $T$ 's - watered down .\n- Haru serves very fresh $T$ , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .\n- $T$ was n't anything spectacular for the price .\n- The $T$ has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .\n- Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good $T$ at a fair price .\n- The duck confit is always amazing and the $T$ was out of this world .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- This place has realy fresh $T$ and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .\n- To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the $T$ offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .\n- The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the $T$ is lovely .\n- I have been here a few times for dinner , once for $T$ and twice for lunch .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- $T$ was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .\n- After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have $T$ .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous $T$ is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\n- Whenever you need a $T$ , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .\n- The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the $T$ to any food allergies or food you do n't like .\n- We were so happy with our $T$ and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .\n- $T$ was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- I 've never had bad service and the $T$ is fresh and delicious .\n- The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for $T$ and even less for lunch .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my $T$ .\n- $T$ - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?\n- Anyway , the $T$ was fake .\n- Here you get the $T$ without feeling rigid .\n- Although be warned their $T$ and take out prices are different .\n- Our $T$ was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the $T$ was not what I had hoped for .\n- The $T$ are very large and the service is fantastic !!\n- I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the $T$ -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was wonderful and imaginative .\n- If you love $T$ and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !\n- The bread is the soft paratha bread -LRB- unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta -RRB- , and the $T$ is tandoori styled and very flavorful .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- I had $T$ it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .\n- THE $T$ ARE REALLY LARGE .\n- The $T$ is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the $T$ .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- Great $T$ experience .\n- $T$ are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .\n- $T$ are rude bit again it 's new york !\n- I found the variety of the $T$ to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- The $T$ is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !\n- Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the $T$ is simply GREAT .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential $T$ -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- the food - not worth the $T$ .\n- The $T$ are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .\n- $T$ were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .\n- Our waiter was helpful and charming , the $T$ was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- From the complimentary $T$ of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .\n- their $T$ are fantastic .\n- First walking in the place seemed to have great $T$ .\n- The $T$ at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !\n- Best things to order are from the grill -LRB- Churrasco and $T$ -RRB- .\n- With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the $T$ here was decent , not great .\n- at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the $T$ playing in the background is also voluminous .\n- I think I 've had some the best $T$ of my life at minnow .\n- A Thai restaurant out of $T$ during dinner ?\n- The last time I went we were seated at a $T$ in a corridor next to the kitchen .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however $T$ or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- $T$ is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .\n- Quite frankly , this is some of the worst $T$ I have ever tried .\n- Too bad the $T$ was n't of the same heritage .\n- $T$ are the perfect size for those hungry nights .\n- We ordered a $T$ and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like $T$ or a side .\n- Reasonable $T$ .\n- I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent $T$ experience .\n- I also recommend the $T$ or the different varieties of congee -LRB- rice porridge -RRB- .\n- The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold $T$ to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- The main course had an average $T$ , and was decent overall .\n- First the wrong $T$ came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...\n- The service was friendly and the $T$ was casual .\n- Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty $T$ guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .\n- The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the $T$ is great .\n- Also , specify if you like your $T$ spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential diners -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating $T$ of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Succulent $T$ cooked precisely to your desired ` doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .\n- Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour $T$ , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?\n- We even had a visit from the $T$ who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .\n- The $T$ give you some sample slices of your order while you wait -LRB- shortly I might add -RRB- .\n- But they do n't have a $T$ , which is strange .\n- Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this $T$ , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly $T$ wine that was n't as good .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the $T$ of the meat -RRB- .\n- Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the $T$ is great .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- Great $T$ at reasonable prices .\n- They are $T$ with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .\n- Build a $T$ with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .\n- BE CAREFUL before you request extra $T$ .\n- The first time I went , and was completely taken by the $T$ and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .\n- I love to visit Murrays for my $T$ fix .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- $T$ include flan and sopaipillas .\n- It is also extremely well $T$ .\n- The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the $T$ arrives .\n- Entrees include classics like lasagna , $T$ and chicken parmigiana .\n- Go for the $T$ .\n- The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex $T$ needs to be cleaned more often .\n- We started with lox and mussels -LRB- the best ive ever had , ever -RRB- and had the cod and $T$ for dinner .\n- $T$ was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -LRB- though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -RRB- .\n- The worst excuse for $T$ I 've ever encountered .\n- I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu -LRB- $ 19.95 for $T$ , steak frites , creme brulee -RRB- and it was marvelous .\n- I would n't even have complained at all if the $T$ at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .\n- But the main hit was the $T$ .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Service was good and so was the $T$ .\n- We always enjoy the $T$ .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- His wife Tanya , the $T$ , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .\n- In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful $T$ that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .\n- We arrived for $T$ expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !\n- Do n't go alone -- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with $T$ and a selection of meats and seafoods .\n- The $T$ are ok , but the service is slow .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked $T$ .\n- The $T$ is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .\n- The second you walk through the heavy vault like $T$ , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and $T$ and glass noodles .\n- The quail was fantastic and unique and the $T$ were full of flavor .\n- The service is outstanding and my $T$ could not have been better .\n- Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for $T$ , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .\n- If I could rate the $T$ this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .\n- word of advice , save room for $T$ and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .\n- the $T$ was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .\n- I 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the $T$ .\n- Fresh , authentic , $T$ in substantial portions .\n- but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free $T$ -LRB- nice non-sushi selection -RRB- .\n- The $T$ is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , $T$ , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the $T$ , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- We could have made a $T$ of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .\n- The $T$ was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .\n- the $T$ - not worth the price .\n- Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some $T$ lover 's brunch .\n- This particular location certainly uses substandard $T$ .\n- You should pass on the $T$ .\n- To my right , the $T$ stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .\n- If you like seafood and/or $T$ you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .\n- This $T$ has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same $T$ that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .\n- I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good $T$ .\n- For the $T$ , a little too expensive .\n- Food was good and the $T$ of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .\n- The closest that I got was the $T$ , but they were out of it that day .\n- Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not $T$ on them .\n- I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine $T$ , even with no idea how to use them .\n- Great $T$ and great cocktail menu .\n- $T$ drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .\n- He takes real pride in his $T$ and his business .\n- I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got $T$ .\n- Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though - too much avocado and $T$ will fill you up right quick .\n- It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic $T$ .\n- We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added $T$ and kielbasa to dip .\n- Very nice touch that very much fits the $T$ .\n- The $T$ from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Way too much money for such a terrible $T$ .\n- I have to say I have never had a disapointing $T$ here .\n- We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large $T$ , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .\n- good $T$ to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .\n- MY date and I both ordered the $T$ and both felt the fish was very average .\n- Note that they do not serve $T$ , you must bring your own .\n- This is a consistently great place to $T$ for lunch or dinner .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a $T$ , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- delicious simple food in nice outdoor $T$ .\n- For $T$ I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .\n- The spicy $T$ is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of $T$ and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I choose to go with one of the special , the $T$ , which was excellent .\n- Definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the $T$ .\n- My host asked for $T$ for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and $T$ to dip .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- The food is all-around good , with the $T$ usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level .\n- Of course this $T$ is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?\n- The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the $T$ they make with imported flour , makes this is one of the better pizza 's in NY .\n- The $T$ was small , thoroughly unremarkable , and $ 14.95 .\n- I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice $T$ .\n- Besides having the $T$ we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served -LRB- and that order was undercooked -RRB- , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .\n- I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE $T$ .\n- The $T$ was even better !\n- This big draw is the all you can $T$ here for $ 19.95 !\n- I particularly love their $T$ and their mussel selection .\n- In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave $T$ .\n- If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality $T$ , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\n- You must try the $T$ .\n- This is some really good , inexpensive $T$ .\n- They are served on $T$ and are to die for .\n- Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and $T$ which are good for an afternoon snack .\n- The place itself is beautiful the $T$ seems to be happening .\n- The $T$ was rather over cooked and dried but the chicken was fine .\n- but their $T$ was YUMMY !\n- They smell like they stuff them with old $T$ like the spinach mushroom calzone .\n- However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a $T$ ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .\n- Sweet Irish $T$ is always happy and able to bring a smile to my friends a my face .\n- Anyway , the food is good , the $T$ is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- The food was excellent - authentic $T$ made absolutely fresh .\n- If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar $T$ then you 'll love it here .\n- My husband said he could 've eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the $T$ were the best he has had .\n- After all that , they complained to me about the small $T$ .\n- Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and $T$ .\n- Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh $T$ and great portions all at a reasonable price .\n- Any if you have a $T$ you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar .\n- Overall A oh ya even though there is $T$ it is deff worth it\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an $T$ -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the $T$ , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- If you 're in the neighborhood , definitely stop by for a great $T$ .\n- A beautiful $T$ , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .\n- My suggestion is to $T$ because you 'll want to try the other dishes .\n- Sandwiches , $T$ and salads , like the lemon-dressed cobb , are classic successes .\n- Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the $T$ is a great value .\n- The $T$ is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .\n- Service was good and $T$ is wonderful .\n- The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the $T$ was way too sweet .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the $T$ or the tip , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Friendly and informative $T$ , very attentive and prompt raw bar service .\n- The $T$ is very cool and chill ...\n- Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the $T$ .\n- Overall , the

is so bad .\n- We had a birthday party here recently and the food and $T$ was amazing .\n- It 's really also the $T$ , is good and the waiters are friendly .\n- Save your money and do n't waste your

here was great , food was fantastic .\n- sometimes i get good food and ok $T$ .\n- The $T$ is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .\n- The $T$ was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark .\n- The wine the $T$ was very good too .\n- Yet paired with such rude $T$ , would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of

pleasant atmosphere .\n- Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the $T$ , which was boarderline rude .\n- Otherwise , this place has great $T$ and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .\n- The $T$ , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food -LRB- horrible bartenders -RRB- , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters -LRB- this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff -RRB- getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .\n- The $T$ was excellent and the food was delicious .\n- The $T$ is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict

I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the $T$ and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\n- The $T$ was great as well .\n- Although

impressed with the food and the drinks .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .\n- INCREDIBLY POOR $T$ AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star $T$ featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- Speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly $T$ combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly $T$ ,

portion -RRB- and pasta was fresh and well-prepared .\n- $T$ is excellent , no wait , and you get a lot for the price .\n- If it is n't for the food -LRB- A + + + -RRB- , it must be the $T$ or the ambience .\n- The $T$ is great , my soup always arrives nice and hot .\n- I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic $T$ .\n- When we sat , we got great and fast $T$ .\n- The food was mediocre and the $T$ was severely slow .\n- $T$ was prompt and courteous .\n- $T$ was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .\n- The $T$ is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .\n- If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent $T$ , this is the place .\n- The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the $T$ is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the $T$ was .\n- Great friendly $T$ , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .\n- The $T$ was typical short-order , dinner type .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- You have to increase the $T$ a lot .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- It 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer $T$ has been deemed not of the essence .\n- Great food -LRB- spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry -RRB- , very friendly and no nonsense $T$ and a clean and funky bathroom .\n- With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy $T$ , and management that does n't care .\n- The food is very good and the $T$ is great .\n- Not to be overlooked , the $T$ is excellent .\n- We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the $T$ was slow .\n- Haru

food .\n- I recieved prompt $T$ with a smile .\n- however , it 's the $T$ that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .\n- While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor $T$ -LRB- waiter

appetizers are ok , but the $T$ is slow .\n- Very good $T$ and very good prices .\n- And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of $T$ - delivery is their Achilles ' heel .\n- The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for $T$ , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the $T$ was rude an unattentive .\n- The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of $T$ and food .\n- $T$ was very good and warm .\n- $T$ was quick .\n- Ive been here a bunch of times now and the $T$ is always outstanding .\n- They have it all -- great price , food , and $T$ .\n- Found $T$ above average , but that could be because we were 13 of us .\n- How can hope to stay in business with $T$ like this ?\n- Not only is the cuisine the best around , the $T$ has always been attentive and charming .\n- The place is so cool and the $T$ is prompt and curtious .\n- Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good $T$ .\n- Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the $T$ is this friendly .\n- The $T$ was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .\n- $T$ is known for bending over backwards to make everyone happy .\n- $T$ was very friendly .\n- Great pizza and fantastic $T$ .\n- We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the $T$ was great !\n- The $T$ was outstanding .\n- THE $T$ IS PERFECT TOO NOTHING WRONG IN THIS ITALIAN/FRENCH RESTAURANT\n- The $T$ was ok .\n- However , the food and $T$ and dramatically lacking .\n- everything is scrumptious , from the excellent $T$ by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere .\n- $T$ was prompt , friendly and great .\n- The absolute worst $T$ I 've ever experienced and the food was below average -LRB- when they actually gave people the meals they ordered -RRB- .\n- The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the $T$ could have been better .\n- We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the $T$ was really good .\n- THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the $T$ too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .\n- Great food but the $T$ was dreadful !\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the $T$ professional wan warm .\n- The $T$ is awful -- the last time I was there -LRB- and I do mean the last time -RRB- we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .\n- Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and $T$ is fast .\n- $T$ was good and so was the atmosphere .\n- They have very quick $T$ which is great when you do n't have much time .\n- The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible $T$ that made me vow never to go back .\n- The food was amazing , and the $T$ was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .\n- $T$ is usually pretty good .\n- Fast $T$ .\n- Great food , great lay out and awesome $T$ .\n- The $T$ is awful .\n- Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best $T$ you will find in even the largest of restaurants .\n- The $T$ is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .\n- Quick and friendly $T$ .\n- The $T$ was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- The $T$ was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and $T$ .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest $T$ and often free desserts .\n- $T$ - friendly and attentive .\n- The $T$ is pretty good .\n- Finally , I got sick of the bad $T$ , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .\n- The $T$ is really fast and friendly , and the value is great .\n- Disappointing food , lousy $T$ .\n- The $T$ was excellent - friendly and attentive .\n- We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and $T$ .\n- The food was great and the $T$ was even better .\n- The $T$ is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .\n- The $T$ is descent even when this small place is packed .\n- $T$ is average .\n- What a difference , the $T$ was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .\n- The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt $T$ .\n- The $T$ was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .\n- The $T$ is ok but could be better .\n- Rao 's has the best $T$ and atmosphere in NYC .\n- The food , drinks and $T$ are clearly among the best in the city .\n- The $T$ is excellent and always informative without an air .\n- The $T$ was excellent and the food was delicious .\n- I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff

Fabulous $T$ , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .\n- mojitos and the $T$ are the best part in there\n- Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great $T$ .\n- $T$ was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .\n- The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the $T$ industry , I understood they were busy .\n- not the food , not the ambiance , not the $T$ , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .\n- For the people who want great food plus great $T$ , Roxy is a place to AVOID !\n- Good $T$ , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !\n- It 's a shame that

.\n- Food and $T$ was okay .\n- If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good $T$ , definitely visit Curry Leaf .\n- The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the $T$ is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .\n- A very inviting restaurant , with friendly $T$ .\n- And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and $T$ !\n- Great food , good size menu , great $T$ and an unpretensious setting .\n- Good , fast $T$ .\n- This place is classy , chic , the $T$ is warm

that ambience !\n- There is no excuse for such lousy $T$ !\n- I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL -LRB- OR BAD $T$ -RRB- @ PIGALLE .\n- The $T$ was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .\n- The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the $T$ or the atmosphere .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and $T$ overcompensate .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the $T$ is great .\n- I 've never had bad $T$ and the fish is fresh and delicious .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- While the food was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the $T$ was horrendous .\n- they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the $T$ was horrible .\n- The $T$ was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\n- A con was the slow $T$ .\n- $T$ could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -LRB- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -RRB- in the restaurant experience .\n- Horrible food and Horrible $T$ .\n- Turned out there was full $T$ upstairs and sat down .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and $T$ are right on target .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent $T$ , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .\n\n【グループB】\n- Ive asked a $T$ for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and $T$ and ar food was just what we were looking for .\n- Once for $T$ and once for brunch .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and $T$ .\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- Good , because hey , it 's more $T$ , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .\n- Try the $T$ -LRB- not on menu -RRB- .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ is so cheap and the waiters are nice .\n- The main draw of this place is the $T$ .\n- Highly recommend this as great value for excellent $T$ and service .\n- The wine and $T$ plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .\n- The $T$ had a nice selection .\n- The only weird thing was if we got a $T$ , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable $T$ , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE $T$ .\n- We went here for $T$ a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .\n- The $T$ were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- I liked the food at this $T$ restaurant .\n- The $T$ is average and the prices are anything but .\n- The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with $T$ .\n- The food was great - sushi was good , but the $T$ amazed us .\n- The best thing I tasted were the $T$ .\n- $T$ came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .\n- The $T$ was absolutely amazing !!\n- I never had an $T$ before so I gave it a shot .\n- We began with the $T$ -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and kielbasa to dip .\n- Dug the $T$ too .\n- From beginning appetizers , the $T$ were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- do n't get me wrong - $T$ was good , just not fantastic .\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our $T$ and each other .\n- The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other $T$ , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -LRB- avocado shrimp -RRB- were quite good .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring $T$ or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the $T$ sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !\n- For the $T$ , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The $T$ are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .\n- The waiters are sweet , the $T$ is tasty and the bill is never too large .\n- We wo n't go to this place again for a good $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the $T$ intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- Some $T$ get their wish .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- The $T$ is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out $T$ and environment .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced $T$ with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- $T$ tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .\n- I choose to go with one of the $T$ , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .\n- Even better , they know how to cook French classics like $T$ and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .\n- Good $T$ at the restaurant -LRB- a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date -RRB- .\n- The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the $T$ were stale .\n- The $T$ 's - watered down .\n- Haru serves very fresh $T$ , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .\n- $T$ was n't anything spectacular for the price .\n- The $T$ has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .\n- Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good $T$ at a fair price .\n- The duck confit is always amazing and the $T$ was out of this world .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- This place has realy fresh $T$ and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .\n- To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the $T$ offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .\n- The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the $T$ is lovely .\n- I have been here a few times for dinner , once for $T$ and twice for lunch .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- $T$ was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .\n- After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have $T$ .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous $T$ is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\n- Whenever you need a $T$ , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .\n- The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the $T$ to any food allergies or food you do n't like .\n- We were so happy with our $T$ and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .\n- $T$ was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- I 've never had bad service and the $T$ is fresh and delicious .\n- The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for $T$ and even less for lunch .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my $T$ .\n- $T$ - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?\n- Anyway , the $T$ was fake .\n- Here you get the $T$ without feeling rigid .\n- Although be warned their $T$ and take out prices are different .\n- Our $T$ was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the $T$ was not what I had hoped for .\n- The $T$ are very large and the service is fantastic !!\n- I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the $T$ -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was wonderful and imaginative .\n- If you love $T$ and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !\n- The bread is the soft paratha bread -LRB- unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta -RRB- , and the $T$ is tandoori styled and very flavorful .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- I had $T$ it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .\n- THE $T$ ARE REALLY LARGE .\n- The $T$ is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the $T$ .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- Great $T$ experience .\n- $T$ are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .\n- $T$ are rude bit again it 's new york !\n- I found the variety of the $T$ to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- The $T$ is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !\n- Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the $T$ is simply GREAT .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential $T$ -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- the food - not worth the $T$ .\n- The $T$ are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .\n- $T$ were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .\n- Our waiter was helpful and charming , the $T$ was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- From the complimentary $T$ of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .\n- their $T$ are fantastic .\n- First walking in the place seemed to have great $T$ .\n- The $T$ at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !\n- Best things to order are from the grill -LRB- Churrasco and $T$ -RRB- .\n- With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the $T$ here was decent , not great .\n- at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the $T$ playing in the background is also voluminous .\n- I think I 've had some the best $T$ of my life at minnow .\n- A Thai restaurant out of $T$ during dinner ?\n- The last time I went we were seated at a $T$ in a corridor next to the kitchen .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous

promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the

better !\n- This big draw is the all you can $T$ here for $ 19.95 !\n- I particularly love their $T$ and their mussel selection .\n- In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark chicken that had that

very disappointing experience .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n\n【グループB】\n- The $T$ greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .\n- Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and $T$ .\n- There 's $T$ and music .\n- Great food , great lay out and awesome $T$ .\n- the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge $T$ , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .\n- However , if you want great $T$ at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .\n- Aside from the rushed $T$ , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow $T$ and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- Upon entering , we were greeted by the $T$ , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .\n- Their $T$ is to die for .\n- After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the $T$ was supposed to taste like .\n- then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the $T$ for additional people .\n- At the end you 're left with a mild $T$ that you can slurp out of a cup .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - $T$ - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Try the Pad Se-Ew or $T$ for a memorable and repeatable experience .\n- The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only $T$ that 's really good .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Sake collection was excellent -LRB- Try $T$ -RRB- , but pricy .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of $T$ overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- The $T$ were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .\n- The service was excellent and the $T$ was delicious .\n- I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the $T$ is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .\n- The $T$ is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- The $T$ was actually aweful .\n- If you love seafood , you would love this $T$ !\n- Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their $T$ .\n- It 's charmingly small and that leads to an $T$ that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .\n- my picks : Guizhou chicken , $T$ , fish fillet in spicy source -LRB- special menu -RRB- .\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- I ordered the $T$ and it was off flavor .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ however was very good .\n- Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his $T$ , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- Yes , they use fancy $T$ , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\n- The $T$ came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch !!!!!\n- We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , $T$ , and service .\n- The $T$ were pretty good .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- This $T$ is the most Japanese it can ever get .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- They have a very good $T$ and good tuna as well .\n- The $T$ , however , was a bright flower in a garden .\n- The food was mediocre and the $T$ was severely slow .\n- Great $T$ , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- They have authentic $T$ at amazin prices .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- When he finally did , he was unable to make a $T$ -- could n't find tonic .\n- A narrow corridor leads to a tiny $T$ where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess -LRB- stacks of bottles , cans -RRB- and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The menu is great , with a good $T$ , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the $T$ is more than alive .\n- The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the $T$ is out of this world !\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the $T$ and service could have been a lot better .\n- Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the $T$ was ridiculously small .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in $T$ , taste , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Nothing better than buying a $T$ for $ 3.25 too .\n- Great romantic $T$ for a date -LRB- try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! -RRB- .\n- Excellent $T$ for only $ 6.95 .\n- The $T$ is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The $T$ is always fresh too .\n- The $T$ was so-so .\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the $T$ is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Other guests enjoyed $T$ , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .\n- Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' $T$ experience .\n- The $T$ and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .\n- The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no $T$ at all .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n- love the $T$ .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy $T$ from the dumpling menu .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the $T$ .\n- Best of all is the warm $T$ , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\n- Drawbacks : $T$ is slow and they do n't toast !\n- The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the $T$ was very friendly .\n- The $T$ was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- We had $T$ at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .\n- They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the $T$ is consistent .\n- The $T$ was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .\n- If it is n't for the food -LRB- A + + + -RRB- , it must be the $T$ or the ambience .\n- The $T$ is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , $T$ , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the $T$ , and a good bottle of wine .\n- If you like $T$ get the chicken vindaloo .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Aside from the $T$ , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the $T$ magnificant .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- The food is great , I love their dumplings , $T$ , chicken and shrimp dishs .\n- A great choice at any $T$ and a great deal .\n- This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , $T$ , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- my picks are : - $T$ -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the $T$ was practically empty .\n- The $T$ was sweet and luscious .\n- You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful $T$ .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table -LRB- even though we had $T$ -RRB- .\n- From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious $T$ , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- The $T$ is courteous and friendly .\n- The $T$ is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .\n- We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the $T$ was wonderful .\n- Authentic food and they have REAL $T$ , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the $T$ .\n- It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded $T$ at dinnertime .\n- At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and $T$ are uncomfortably close .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the $T$ was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .\n- The $T$ are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\n- My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the $T$ was not very flavorful .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- And the $T$ was outragous .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the $T$ were !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland $T$ - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- The $T$ is great and authentic .\n- Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the $T$ you pay for them .\n- The $T$ and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming $T$ filled with candles and family pictures .\n- As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to $T$ .\n- Not only was the $T$ fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the duck !\n- The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the $T$ were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -LRB- not iceberg -RRB- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and $T$ could have been a lot better .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome $T$ and Hibiscus lemonade .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- The $T$ itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .\n- The only friendly $T$ was the guy at the bar .\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ - all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- This is such a lovely , peaceful $T$ to eat outside .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- The food is great -LRB- big $T$ , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- My host asked for appetizers for the group and the $T$ gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- It is kinda nosiy and the $T$ are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the $T$ , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- My entree of $T$ was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .\n- I love the drinks , esp $T$ , and the food is also VERY good .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have $T$ , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the $T$ were awesome !\n- Good $T$ and good cream cheese .\n- I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of $T$ .\n- Good service , great food , good value , and never have to $T$ in line !\n- And , atlhough $T$ opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- They have $T$ made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .\n- The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the $T$ is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting $T$ and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the $T$ .\n- Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , $T$ , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...\n- Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour $T$ place anyways ?\n- I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the $T$ are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- The $T$ is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- Make sure you have the $T$ . . .\n- The $T$ is awful -- the last time I was there -LRB- and I do mean the last time -RRB- we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .\n- It is a lot of fun with $T$ and all kinds of Disney type special effects .\n- The $T$ is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- And the $T$ is also young , energeic and hot !!!!\n- The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used

the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .\n- But the $T$ is way to expensive .\n- This $T$ has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .\n- So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their $T$ .\n- Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the $T$ who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .\n- $T$ is so very fresh .\n- The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of $T$ I received from one of the food runners ,

nothing but good things to say about the $T$ and the great staff at La Lanterna .\n- The $T$ covers a wide variety without being imposeing .\n- Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill $T$ .\n- It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out $T$ , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .\n- INCREDIBLY POOR $T$ AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .\n- The $T$ is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .\n- BUt their best dish is thh $T$ - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , $T$ , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo

fish was not fresh and the $T$ tasted old and stale .\n- I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the $T$ and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\n- I must warn the reader that the $T$ sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .\n- The $T$ is very good and the service is great .\n- Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per $T$ , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !\n- Kosher dills

fish is nothing out of ordinary .\n- My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the $T$ ...\n- Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the $T$ was good .\n- Small $T$ for main entree , i had salmon -LRB- wasnt impressed -RRB- girlfriend had chicken , it was good .\n- In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like

smirks , and snotty back talk .\n- The wine selection -LRB- by the glass and bottle -RRB- is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a $T$ if they 're going to be in town .\n- If I wanted to deal with a crappy $T$ and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .\n- I ordered a $T$ and found that the chicken was extremely dry .\n- Not enough $T$ either .\n- The $T$ was dreadfully slow -LRB- the place was only half full -RRB- and a smile would have been nice ...\n- I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a $T$ at a local bar first though because of the wait time .\n- now if they could only get a $T$ .\n- The $T$ is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .\n- The $T$ are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\n- And the $T$ were way to high for what you get .\n- The $T$ is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .\n- Thick fries , $T$ and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate Frosty .\n- Great wine list and great $T$ .\n- As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his $T$ for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .\n- All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the $T$ is some of the best .\n- The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the $T$ .\n- I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine $T$ that is definitely a value for your dollar .\n- Because of the delicate thin $T$ , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .\n- Young neighborhood trendies graze at the $T$ during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice $T$ in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .\n- Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a $T$ of the fabulous trying to be seen .\n- The $T$ was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .\n- I recommend the $T$ , okra -LRB- bindi -RRB- , and anything with lamb .\n- I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the $T$ but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .\n- I 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I 'm craving for $T$ , Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice , this is the place to go .\n- However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the $T$ hit the spot .\n- good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a $T$ .\n- i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese $T$ , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto $T$ cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great $T$ in a pleasant atmosphere .\n- You must have the $T$ which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .\n- Service was devine , $T$ where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and $T$ are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .\n- Disappointing food , lousy $T$ .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- The $T$ is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .\n- Traditional French decour was pleasant though the $T$ was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\n- Really tasty spring rolls and $T$ for a good price though .\n- The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the $T$ for about 20 minutes before we were seated .\n- We started with lox and $T$ -LRB- the best ive ever had ,

cute waitresses , to the extremely lush $T$ .\n- Cool $T$ but such a let down .\n- And forget what you read under me , the $T$ is n't that bad either .\n- For those prices and the dressed up $T$ you expect more and should get more .\n- Of course this $T$ is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?\n- It 's just everything ... the food , the $T$ ... the incrediby kind and gracious hostess .\n- We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun $T$ and good food .\n- While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely $T$ , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .\n- The place is a BISTRO

great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the $T$ can be both romantic and comfortable .\n- I almost hesititate to write a review because the $T$ was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .\n- It does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other $T$ .\n- Eating in , the $T$ saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n\n【グループB】\n- The $T$ greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .\n- Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and $T$ .\n- There 's $T$ and music .\n- Great food , great lay out and awesome $T$ .\n- the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge $T$ , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .\n- However , if you want great $T$ at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .\n- Aside from the rushed $T$ , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow $T$ and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- Upon entering , we were greeted by the $T$ , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .\n- Their $T$ is to die for .\n- After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the $T$ was supposed to taste like .\n- then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the $T$ for additional people .\n- At the end you 're left with a mild $T$ that you can slurp out of a cup .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - $T$ - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Try the Pad Se-Ew or $T$ for a memorable and repeatable experience .\n- The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only $T$ that 's really good .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Sake collection was excellent -LRB- Try $T$ -RRB- , but pricy .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of $T$ overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- The $T$ were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .\n- The service was excellent and the $T$ was delicious .\n- I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the $T$ is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .\n- The $T$ is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- The $T$ was actually aweful .\n- If you love seafood , you would love this $T$ !\n- Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their $T$ .\n- It 's charmingly small and that leads to an $T$ that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .\n- my picks : Guizhou chicken , $T$ , fish fillet in spicy source -LRB- special menu -RRB- .\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- I ordered the $T$ and it was off flavor .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ however was very good .\n- Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his $T$ , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- Yes , they use fancy $T$ , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\n- The $T$ came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch !!!!!\n- We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , $T$ , and service .\n- The $T$ were pretty good .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- This $T$ is the most Japanese it can ever get .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- They have a very good $T$ and good tuna as well .\n- The $T$ , however , was a bright flower in a garden .\n- The food was mediocre and the $T$ was severely slow .\n- Great $T$ , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- They have authentic $T$ at amazin prices .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- When he finally did , he was unable to make a $T$ -- could n't find tonic .\n- A narrow corridor leads to a tiny $T$ where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess -LRB- stacks of bottles , cans -RRB- and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The menu is great , with a good $T$ , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the $T$ is more than alive .\n- The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the $T$ is out of this world !\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the $T$ and service could have been a lot better .\n- Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the $T$ was ridiculously small .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in $T$ , taste , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Nothing better than buying a $T$ for $ 3.25 too .\n- Great romantic $T$ for a date -LRB- try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! -RRB- .\n- Excellent $T$ for only $ 6.95 .\n- The $T$ is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The $T$ is always fresh too .\n- The $T$ was so-so .\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the $T$ is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Other guests enjoyed $T$ , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .\n- Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' $T$ experience .\n- The $T$ and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .\n- The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no $T$ at all .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n- love the $T$ .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy $T$ from the dumpling menu .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the $T$ .\n- Best of all is the warm $T$ , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\n- Drawbacks : $T$ is slow and they do n't toast !\n- The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the $T$ was very friendly .\n- The $T$ was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- We had $T$ at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .\n- They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the $T$ is consistent .\n- The $T$ was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .\n- If it is n't for the food -LRB- A + + + -RRB- , it must be the $T$ or the ambience .\n- The $T$ is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , $T$ , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the $T$ , and a good bottle of wine .\n- If you like $T$ get the chicken vindaloo .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Aside from the $T$ , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the $T$ magnificant .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- The food is great , I love their dumplings , $T$ , chicken and shrimp dishs .\n- A great choice at any $T$ and a great deal .\n- This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , $T$ , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- my picks are : - $T$ -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the $T$ was practically empty .\n- The $T$ was sweet and luscious .\n- You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful $T$ .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table -LRB- even though we had $T$ -RRB- .\n- From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious $T$ , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- The $T$ is courteous and friendly .\n- The $T$ is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .\n- We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the $T$ was wonderful .\n- Authentic food and they have REAL $T$ , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the $T$ .\n- It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded $T$ at dinnertime .\n- At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and $T$ are uncomfortably close .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the $T$ was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .\n- The $T$ are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\n- My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the $T$ was not very flavorful .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- And the $T$ was outragous .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the $T$ were !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland $T$ - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- The $T$ is great and authentic .\n- Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the $T$ you pay for them .\n- The $T$ and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming $T$ filled with candles and family pictures .\n- As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to $T$ .\n- Not only was the $T$ fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the duck !\n- The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the $T$ were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -LRB- not iceberg -RRB- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and $T$ could have been a lot better .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome $T$ and Hibiscus lemonade .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- The $T$ itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .\n- The only friendly $T$ was the guy at the bar .\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ - all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- This is such a lovely , peaceful $T$ to eat outside .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- The food is great -LRB- big $T$ , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- My host asked for appetizers for the group and the $T$ gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- It is kinda nosiy and the $T$ are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the $T$ , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- My entree of $T$ was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .\n- I love the drinks , esp $T$ , and the food is also VERY good .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have $T$ , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the $T$ were awesome !\n- Good $T$ and good cream cheese .\n- I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of $T$ .\n- Good service , great food , good value , and never have to $T$ in line !\n- And , atlhough $T$ opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- They have $T$ made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .\n- The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the $T$ is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting $T$ and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the $T$ .\n- Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , $T$ , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...\n- Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour $T$ place anyways ?\n- I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the $T$ are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- The $T$ is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- Make sure you have the $T$ . . .\n- The $T$ is awful -- the last time I was there -LRB- and I do mean the last time -RRB- we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .\n- It is a lot of fun with $T$ and all kinds of Disney type special effects .\n- The $T$ is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- And the $T$ is also young , energeic and hot !!!!\n- The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used $T$ .\n- Fluke sashimi drizzled with $T$ , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .\n- The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the $T$ industry , I understood they were busy .\n- Great food , good wine and an excellent $T$ .\n- We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and $T$ asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .\n- Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the $T$ .\n- Everyone who works there -LRB- the $T$ , the bartender , the servers -RRB- is so helpful .\n- Great $T$ .\n- I go back in $T$ like three times on average until I ca n't walk anymore .\n- This $T$ is asian-air fusion .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ there is very attentive and down to earth .\n- This $T$ has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\n- $T$ is very accomodating .\n- Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' $T$ ' were great .\n- My daughter and I left feeling satisfied -LRB- not stuffed -RRB- and it felt good to know we had a healthy $T$ .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- The $T$ is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .\n- The $T$ is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .\n- I ordered the $T$ and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .\n- The host -LRB- owner -RRB- and $T$ are personable and caring .\n- $T$ are always friendly .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great $T$ .\n- You can even get packages of the $T$ to stock your fridge !\n- The bread and $T$ I had before the meal were quite good , however .\n- While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on $T$ in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .\n- The owners and employees are friendly and their $T$ is fantastic .\n- It wo n't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the $T$ .\n- It 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have $T$ or dine-in .\n- When you 're sitting in their main dining room -LRB- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high $T$ -RRB- you 'd never know there was a world outside .\n- Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the $T$ was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .\n- But the $T$ is way to expensive .\n- This $T$ has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .\n- So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their $T$ .\n- Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the $T$ who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .\n- $T$ is so very fresh .\n- The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of $T$ I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .\n- Cute $T$ , nice wait staff but would never go there again .\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the $T$ and the drinks .\n- The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the $T$ huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .\n- $T$ is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .\n- I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the $T$ fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .\n- It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty $T$ , but standing up was n't too bad .\n- $T$ is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !\n- The ` kamasutra ' and ' $T$ ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .\n- Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great $T$ and has great food !\n- A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty $T$ at dirt-cheap prices .\n- I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the $T$ and the great staff at La Lanterna .\n- The $T$ covers a wide variety without being imposeing .\n- Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill $T$ .\n- It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out $T$ , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .\n- INCREDIBLY POOR $T$ AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .\n- The $T$ is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .\n- BUt their best dish is thh $T$ - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , $T$ , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Immediately after we paid , the $T$ took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .\n- I would like to return and try some of the other $T$ when I do n't have to rush off to a show .\n- And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our $T$ by knocking over a glass of water .\n- They offer the same $T$ but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .\n- Best $T$ I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .\n- Lunch came with $T$ , no extra charge .\n- The fish was not fresh and the $T$ tasted old and stale .\n- I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the $T$ and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\n- I must warn the reader that the $T$ sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .\n- The $T$ is very good and the service is great .\n- Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per $T$ , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !\n- Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable $T$ and they give you plenty of them .\n- Given the incredible $T$ surrounding it , this place has no character .\n- My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt $T$ .\n- $T$ was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .\n- If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of $T$ the chart house has to offer .\n- To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute $T$ and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .\n- Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , $T$ , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The $T$ is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .\n- My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the $T$ ...\n- Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the $T$ was good .\n- Small $T$ for main entree , i had salmon -LRB- wasnt impressed -RRB- girlfriend had chicken , it was good .\n- In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and $T$ , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .\n- After $T$ I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .\n- The $T$ are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .\n- Consistently good $T$ .\n- Largest and freshest $T$ , and delicious !\n- They charge different $T$ all the time .\n- They are the best $T$ I 've had .\n- We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the sushi plate while I had the $T$ .\n- Finally , I got sick of the bad $T$ , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .\n- The wine selection -LRB- by the glass and bottle -RRB- is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a $T$ if they 're going to be in town .\n- If I wanted to deal with a crappy $T$ and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .\n- I ordered a $T$ and found that the chicken was extremely dry .\n- Not enough $T$ either .\n- The $T$ was dreadfully slow -LRB- the place was only half full -RRB- and a smile would have been nice ...\n- I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a $T$ at a local bar first though because of the wait time .\n- now if they could only get a $T$ .\n- The $T$ is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .\n- The $T$ are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\n- And the $T$ were way to high for what you get .\n- The $T$ is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .\n- Thick fries , $T$ and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate Frosty .\n- Great wine list and great $T$ .\n- As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his $T$ for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .\n- All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the $T$ is some of the best .\n- The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the $T$ .\n- I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine $T$ that is definitely a value for your dollar .\n- Because of the delicate thin $T$ , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .\n- Young neighborhood trendies graze at the $T$ during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice $T$ in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .\n- Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a $T$ of the fabulous trying to be seen .\n- The $T$ was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .\n- I recommend the $T$ , okra -LRB- bindi -RRB- , and anything with lamb .\n- I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the $T$ but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am .\n- I 've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I 'm craving for $T$ , Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice , this is the place to go .\n- However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the $T$ hit the spot .\n- good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a $T$ .\n- i 've noticed megadeth , mr. scruff , st. germain , traditional vietnamese $T$ , black sabbath , jay-z , and daft punk all being played .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto $T$ cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great $T$ in a pleasant atmosphere .\n- You must have the $T$ which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .\n- Service was devine , $T$ where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and $T$ are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .\n- Disappointing food , lousy $T$ .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- The $T$ is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .\n- Traditional French decour was pleasant though the $T$ was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\n- Really tasty spring rolls and $T$ for a good price though .\n- The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the $T$ for about 20 minutes before we were seated .\n- We started with lox and $T$ -LRB- the best ive ever had , ever -RRB- and had the cod and trout for dinner .\n- Pizza and $T$ are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick

and gracious hostess .\n- We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun $T$ and good food .\n- While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely $T$ , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .\n- The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling $T$ .\n- For those prices and the dressed up $T$ you expect more and should get more .\n- The $T$ is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .\n- The staff makes you feel at home , the food is great and the $T$ is WONDERFUL !\n- The $T$ is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .\n- Excellent $T$ , delicious dishes good and friendly service .\n- LOVE the $T$ - felt like I was in Paris .\n- delicious simple food in nice outdoor $T$ .\n- LOVE the $T$ - felt like I was in Paris .\n- everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush $T$ .\n- The $T$ is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - $T$ .\n- The $T$ takes you to that place , the place many dream of .\n- It does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other $T$ .\n- they really provide a relaxing , laid-back $T$ .\n- I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great $T$ , good service and a wonderful wine list .\n- The $T$ takes you to that place , the place many dream of .\n- The $T$ is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .\n- they really provide a relaxing , laid-back $T$ .\n- But the best part about LS is the late night $T$ , delightfully free of the BTs .\n- The selection of food is excellent -LRB- I 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants -RRB- , and the $T$ is great .\n- delicious simple food in nice outdoor $T$ .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable $T$ , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- LOVE the $T$ - felt like I was in Paris .\n- I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great $T$ , good service and a wonderful wine list .\n- Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly $T$ .\n- The $T$ is great !!!\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant $T$ .\n- We love the food , drinks , and $T$ !\n- The $T$ is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .\n- I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual $T$ that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine .\n- Of course this $T$ is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?\n- The design and $T$ is just as good .\n- The $T$ is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\n- everything is scrumptious , from the excellent service by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush $T$ .\n- The $T$ is warm , comfortable , artsy and sexy .\n- A beautiful $T$ , perfect for drinks and/or appetizers .\n- We love the food , drinks , and $T$ !\n- Nice $T$ , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .\n- The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous $T$ is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\n- I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great $T$ , good service and a wonderful wine list .\n- It 's just everything ... the food , the $T$ ... the incrediby kind and gracious hostess .\n- $T$ is a bore .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - $T$ .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - $T$ .\n- While the ambiance and $T$ were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .\n- Not only is the service great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the $T$ can be both romantic and comfortable .\n- I almost hesititate to write a review because the $T$ was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .\n- It does n't look like much on the outside , but the minute you walk inside , it 's a whole other $T$ .\n- Eating in , the $T$ saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n\n【グループB】\n- The $T$ greeted me warmly at the door and I was seated promptly and the food was excellent .\n- Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and $T$ .\n- There 's $T$ and music .\n- Great food , great lay out and awesome $T$ .\n- the dinner menu offers a variety of great entrees , including fresh seafood and huge $T$ , there 's also a couple of non-meat alternatives .\n- However , if you want great $T$ at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .\n- Aside from the rushed $T$ , we were very impressed with the food and the drinks .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow $T$ and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .\n- Upon entering , we were greeted by the $T$ , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .\n- Their $T$ is to die for .\n- After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the $T$ was supposed to taste like .\n- then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the $T$ for additional people .\n- At the end you 're left with a mild $T$ that you can slurp out of a cup .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - $T$ - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Try the Pad Se-Ew or $T$ for a memorable and repeatable experience .\n- The food is just OKAY , and it 's almost not worth going unless you 're getting the pialla , which is the only $T$ that 's really good .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Sake collection was excellent -LRB- Try $T$ -RRB- , but pricy .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of $T$ overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- The $T$ were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .\n- The service was excellent and the $T$ was delicious .\n- I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the $T$ is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .\n- The $T$ is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- The $T$ was actually aweful .\n- If you love seafood , you would love this $T$ !\n- Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their $T$ .\n- It 's charmingly small and that leads to an $T$ that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .\n- my picks : Guizhou chicken , $T$ , fish fillet in spicy source -LRB- special menu -RRB- .\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- I ordered the $T$ and it was off flavor .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ however was very good .\n- Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his $T$ , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- Yes , they use fancy $T$ , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\n- The $T$ came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch !!!!!\n- We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , $T$ , and service .\n- The $T$ were pretty good .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- This $T$ is the most Japanese it can ever get .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- They have a very good $T$ and good tuna as well .\n- The $T$ , however , was a bright flower in a garden .\n- The food was mediocre and the $T$ was severely slow .\n- Great $T$ , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- They have authentic $T$ at amazin prices .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- When he finally did , he was unable to make a $T$ -- could n't find tonic .\n- A narrow corridor leads to a tiny $T$ where there are three tiny white tiled counters , a great deal of mess -LRB- stacks of bottles , cans -RRB- and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The menu is great , with a good $T$ , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the $T$ is more than alive .\n- The staff is accomodating , the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed , and the $T$ is out of this world !\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the $T$ and service could have been a lot better .\n- Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the $T$ was ridiculously small .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in $T$ , taste , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Nothing better than buying a $T$ for $ 3.25 too .\n- Great romantic $T$ for a date -LRB- try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close ! -RRB- .\n- Excellent $T$ for only $ 6.95 .\n- The $T$ is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they do n't skimp .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The $T$ is always fresh too .\n- The $T$ was so-so .\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the crust is thinner and crispier , the $T$ is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Other guests enjoyed $T$ , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .\n- Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' $T$ experience .\n- The $T$ and ambience are especially great considering it 's in the West Village .\n- The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no $T$ at all .\n- Over time , the $T$ has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .\n- love the $T$ .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy $T$ from the dumpling menu .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the $T$ .\n- Best of all is the warm $T$ , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\n- Drawbacks : $T$ is slow and they do n't toast !\n- The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the $T$ was very friendly .\n- The $T$ was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- We had $T$ at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .\n- They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the $T$ is consistent .\n- The $T$ was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .\n- If it is n't for the food -LRB- A + + + -RRB- , it must be the $T$ or the ambience .\n- The $T$ is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , $T$ , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the $T$ , and a good bottle of wine .\n- If you like $T$ get the chicken vindaloo .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Aside from the $T$ , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the $T$ magnificant .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- The food is great , I love their dumplings , $T$ , chicken and shrimp dishs .\n- A great choice at any $T$ and a great deal .\n- This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , $T$ , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- my picks are : - $T$ -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the $T$ was practically empty .\n- The $T$ was sweet and luscious .\n- You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful $T$ .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table -LRB- even though we had $T$ -RRB- .\n- From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious $T$ , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- The $T$ is courteous and friendly .\n- The $T$ is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .\n- We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the $T$ was wonderful .\n- Authentic food and they have REAL $T$ , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the $T$ .\n- It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded $T$ at dinnertime .\n- At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and $T$ are uncomfortably close .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the $T$ was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .\n- The $T$ are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\n- My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the $T$ was not very flavorful .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- And the $T$ was outragous .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the $T$ were !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland $T$ - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- The $T$ is great and authentic .\n- Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the $T$ you pay for them .\n- The $T$ and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming $T$ filled with candles and family pictures .\n- As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to $T$ .\n- Not only was the $T$ fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the duck !\n- The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the $T$ were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -LRB- not iceberg -RRB- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and $T$ could have been a lot better .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome $T$ and Hibiscus lemonade .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- The $T$ itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .\n- The only friendly $T$ was the guy at the bar .\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ - all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- This is such a lovely , peaceful $T$ to eat outside .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- The food is great -LRB- big $T$ , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- My host asked for appetizers for the group and the $T$ gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- It is kinda nosiy and the $T$ are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the $T$ , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- My entree of $T$ was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .\n- I love the drinks , esp $T$ , and the food is also VERY good .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have $T$ , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the $T$ were awesome !\n- Good $T$ and good cream cheese .\n- I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of $T$ .\n- Good service , great food , good value , and never have to $T$ in line !\n- And , atlhough $T$ opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- They have $T$ made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .\n- The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the $T$ is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting $T$ and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the $T$ .\n- Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , $T$ , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...\n- Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour $T$ place anyways ?\n- I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the $T$ are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- The $T$ is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- Make sure you have the $T$ . . .\n- The $T$ is awful -- the last time I was there -LRB- and I do mean the last time -RRB- we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .\n- It is a lot of fun with $T$ and all kinds of Disney type special effects .\n- The $T$ is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- And the $T$ is also young , energeic and hot !!!!\n- The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used $T$ .\n- Fluke sashimi drizzled with $T$ , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .\n- The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the $T$ industry , I understood they were busy .\n- Great food , good wine and an excellent $T$ .\n- We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and $T$ asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .\n- Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the $T$ .\n- Everyone who works there -LRB- the $T$ , the bartender , the servers -RRB- is so helpful .\n- Great $T$ .\n- I go back in $T$ like three times on average until I ca n't walk anymore .\n- This $T$ is asian-air fusion .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ there is very attentive and down to earth .\n- This $T$ has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\n- $T$ is very accomodating .\n- Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' $T$ ' were great .\n- My daughter and I left feeling satisfied -LRB- not stuffed -RRB- and it felt good to know we had a healthy $T$ .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- The $T$ is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .\n- The $T$ is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .\n- I ordered the $T$ and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .\n- The host -LRB- owner -RRB- and $T$ are personable and caring .\n- $T$ are always friendly .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great $T$ .\n- You can even get packages of the $T$ to stock your fridge !\n- The bread and $T$ I had before the meal were quite good , however .\n- While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on $T$ in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .\n- The owners and employees are friendly and their $T$ is fantastic .\n- It wo n't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the $T$ .\n- It 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have $T$ or dine-in .\n- When you 're sitting in their main dining room -LRB- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high $T$ -RRB- you 'd never know there was a world outside .\n- Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the $T$ was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .\n- But the $T$ is way to expensive .\n- This $T$ has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .\n- So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their $T$ .\n- Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the $T$ who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .\n- $T$ is so very fresh .\n- The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of $T$ I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .\n- Cute $T$ , nice wait staff but would never go there again .\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the $T$ and the drinks .\n- The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the $T$ huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .\n- $T$ is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .\n- I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the $T$ fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .\n- It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty $T$ , but standing up was n't too bad .\n- $T$ is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !\n- The ` kamasutra ' and ' $T$ ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .\n- Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great $T$ and has great food !\n- A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty $T$ at dirt-cheap prices .\n- I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the $T$ and the great staff at La Lanterna .\n- The $T$ covers a wide variety without being imposeing .\n- Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill $T$ .\n- It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out $T$ , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .\n- INCREDIBLY POOR $T$ AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .\n- The $T$ is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .\n- BUt their best dish is thh $T$ - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , $T$ , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Immediately after we paid , the $T$ took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .\n- I would like to return and try some of the other $T$ when I do n't have to rush off to a show .\n- And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our $T$ by knocking over a glass of water .\n- They offer the same $T$ but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .\n- Best $T$ I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .\n- Lunch came with $T$ , no extra charge .\n- The fish was not fresh and the $T$ tasted old and stale .\n- I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the $T$ and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\n- I must warn the reader that the $T$ sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .\n- The $T$ is very good and the service is great .\n- Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per $T$ , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !\n- Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable $T$ and they give you plenty of them .\n- Given the incredible $T$ surrounding it , this place has no character .\n- My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt $T$ .\n- $T$ was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a Saturday night .\n- If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of $T$ the chart house has to offer .\n- To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute $T$ and started to leave , when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .\n- Aside from the Sea Urchin , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , $T$ , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The $T$ is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .\n- My favs here are the Tacos Pastor and the $T$ ...\n- Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the $T$ was good .\n- Small $T$ for main entree , i had salmon -LRB- wasnt impressed -RRB- girlfriend had chicken , it was good .\n- In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and $T$ , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .\n- After $T$ I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .\n- The $T$ are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when I dropped it outside .\n- Consistently good $T$ .\n- Largest and freshest $T$ , and delicious !\n- They charge different $T$ all the time

smirks , and snotty back talk .\n- The wine selection -LRB- by the glass and bottle -RRB- is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a $T$ if they 're going to be in town .\n- If I wanted to deal with a crappy $T$ and annoying customers I 'd go out in Manhattan .\n- I ordered a $T$ and found that the chicken was extremely dry .\n- Not enough $T$ either .\n- The $T$ was dreadfully slow -LRB- the place was only half full -RRB- and a smile would have been nice ...\n- I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a $T$ at a local bar first though because of the wait time .\n- now if they could only get a $T$ .\n- The $T$ is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited .\n- The $T$ are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\n- And the $T$ were way to high for what you get .\n- The $T$ is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .\n- Thick fries , $T$ and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate Frosty .\n- Great wine list and great $T$ .\n- As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his $T$ for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were .\n- All I can say is $ 2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you 'll find in the city , though the $T$ is some of the best .\n- The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the $T$ .\n- I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine $T$ that is definitely a value for your dollar .\n- Because of the delicate thin $T$ , take-out pies get soggy in their boxes .\n- Young neighborhood trendies graze at the $T$ during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice $T$ in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .\n- Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a $T$ of the fabulous trying to be seen .\n- The $T$ was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .\n- I recommend the $T$ , okra -LRB- bindi -RRB- , and anything with lamb .\n- I live in the neighborhood and my friends

atmosphere .\n- You must have the $T$ which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .\n- Service was devine , $T$ where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and $T$ are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .\n- Disappointing food , lousy $T$ .\n- Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident , but for the rest of us who 've actually eaten $T$ , this is simply dull .\n- The $T$ is also outstanding and is served quite quickly .\n- Traditional French decour was pleasant though the $T$ was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\n- Really tasty spring rolls and $T$ for a good price though .\n- The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the $T$ for about 20 minutes before we were seated .\n- We started with lox and $T$ -LRB- the best ive ever had ,

chef 's passion -LRB- and kitchen 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the $T$ and soups .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family $T$ .\n- The $T$ is excellent .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled $T$ over it -LRB- the sauce was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- I noted it was crossed off on the $T$ .\n- What came to our $T$ was burned beyond recognition and stringy .\n- Here 's to the fake $T$ too ...\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great $T$ .\n- The $T$ here is only so-so .\n- The $T$ was huge .\n- Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your $T$ .\n- I had the $T$ and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few $T$ and enjoy our surroundings and each other .\n- The food is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the $T$ are really good .\n- Great wine selection , $T$ is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- The $T$ is an asbolute steal .\n- Not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the $T$ !\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one $T$ and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- The $T$ had an average portion , and was decent overall .\n- The rice was poor quality and was $T$ so badly it was hard .\n- The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , $T$ keep the palate from stagnating .\n- $T$ Waldy 's always measures up .\n- Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of $T$ of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .\n- They did n't give us the $T$ until we asked for it .\n- Try the $T$ and the rose special roll .\n- I would have gotten some cole slaw and a $T$ if my stomach had more space .\n- We had the $T$ and it was FANTASTIC .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- The bartenders and the $T$ are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .\n- After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me $T$ so I could eat my pie .\n- We could not catch our $T$ 's eye , and he ignored us .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- This is the perfect $T$ for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour $T$ from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .\n- Authentic $T$ .\n- Not impressed with the $T$ .\n- Delicate $T$ , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .\n- The food was just OK , at least for what $T$ was available .\n- If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly $T$ and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with $T$ bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !\n- My daughter and I left feeling satisfied -LRB- not stuffed -RRB- and it felt good to know we had a healthy $T$ .\n- I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious $T$ lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .\n- No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our $T$ .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- And forget what you read under me , the $T$ is n't that bad either .\n- The $T$ are also reasonably priced for NYC .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of $T$ .\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of $T$ , gratis .\n- The $T$ should not be overlooked !\n- I have $T$ about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- Horrible $T$ and Horrible service .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - $T$ - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The $T$ is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .\n- My friends and I experienced amazing $T$ and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .\n- Also a little more expensive than your average $T$ place .\n- The staff was very attentive , the $T$ lovely , and the food superb .\n- Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday $T$ here could n't be happier .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh $T$ .\n- still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were $T$ eventhough they were there much longer ...\n- For all of you new to $T$ , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .\n- The $T$ in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- They have some great $T$ here as well .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary $T$ .\n- The one vegetarian entree -LRB- Abby 's treasure -RRB- was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had $T$ covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .\n- We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent $T$ , which was generous , I feel .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- If you are here as a $T$ , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .\n- Try the $T$ -- ginger lemonade with vodka -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the $T$ has been overhauled .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a $T$ .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the $T$ .\n- It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the $T$ is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\n- $ 20 for all you can eat $T$ can not be beaten .\n- The $T$ and servers are personable and caring .\n- I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud $T$ till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a $T$ , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Great $T$ , lots of people .\n- We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful $T$ experience !!!\n- We were planning to get dessert but the $T$ basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .\n- Our waiter was fine , the $T$ looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .\n- But the $T$ was good .\n- The $T$ is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\n- Tasty steak , $T$ , the works .\n- I had the cod with paella -LRB- spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half -RRB- while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips -LRB- again , a big $T$ - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries -RRB- .\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of $T$ .\n- Casablanca servces delicious falafel , $T$ , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- The $T$ arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , $T$ to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- $T$ and Hostess was quite rude .\n- The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate $T$ !\n- Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass $T$ .\n- Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite $T$ .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , $T$ was great and the food was excellent !\n- I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the $T$ was freindly and knowledgable .\n- Great $T$ at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and $T$ was poor .\n- at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the $T$ are manna from heaven .\n- Simple $T$ and what hot and lage portions .\n- The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested $T$ for my husband he enjoyed his meal .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant $T$ there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a $T$ at the bar .\n- Whether your choose the $T$ or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the $T$ here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .\n- My goodness , everything from the $T$ to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .\n- The $T$ came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful $T$ .\n- We had a party in their $T$ and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent $T$ and a colorful -

Being serious $T$ lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .\n- No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our $T$ .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- And forget what you read under me , the $T$ is n't that bad either .\n- The $T$ are also reasonably priced for NYC .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of $T$ .\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of $T$ , gratis .\n- The $T$ should not be overlooked !\n- I have $T$ about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- Horrible $T$ and Horrible service .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - $T$ - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The $T$ is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .\n- My friends and I experienced amazing $T$ and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .\n- Also a little more expensive than your average $T$ place .\n- The staff was very attentive , the $T$ lovely , and the food superb .\n- Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday $T$ here could n't be happier .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh $T$ .\n- still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were $T$ eventhough they were there much longer ...\n- For all of you new to $T$ , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .\n- The $T$ in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- They have some great $T$ here as well .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary $T$ .\n- The one vegetarian entree -LRB- Abby 's treasure -RRB- was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had $T$ covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .\n- We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent $T$ , which was generous , I feel .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- If you are here as a $T$ , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .\n- Try the $T$ -- ginger lemonade with vodka -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the $T$ has been overhauled .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a $T$ .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the $T$ .\n- It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the $T$ is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\n- $ 20 for all you can eat $T$ can not be beaten .\n- The $T$ and servers are personable and caring .\n- I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud $T$ till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a $T$ , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Great $T$ , lots of people .\n- We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful $T$ experience !!!\n- We were planning to get dessert but the $T$ basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .\n- Our waiter was fine , the $T$ looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .\n- But the $T$ was good .\n- The $T$ is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\n- Tasty steak , $T$ , the works .\n- I had the cod with paella -LRB- spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half -RRB- while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips -LRB- again , a big $T$ - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries -RRB- .\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of $T$ .\n- Casablanca servces delicious falafel , $T$ , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- The $T$ arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , $T$ to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- $T$ and Hostess was quite rude .\n- The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate $T$ !\n- Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass $T$ .\n- Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite $T$ .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , $T$ was great and the food was excellent !\n- I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the $T$ was freindly and knowledgable .\n- Great $T$ at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and $T$ was poor .\n- at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the $T$ are manna from heaven .\n- Simple $T$ and what hot and lage portions .\n- The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested $T$ for my husband he enjoyed his meal .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant $T$ there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a $T$ at the bar .\n- Whether your choose the $T$ or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the $T$ here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .\n- My goodness , everything from the $T$ to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .\n- The $T$ came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful $T$ .\n- We had a party in their $T$ and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent $T$ and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .\n- When the $T$ arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .\n- I ordered $T$ and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .\n- Plus they made a perfect $T$ .\n- The waiters were not attentive except that the $T$ turned up on the table before we were finished .\n- I would like to return and try some of the other $T$ when I do n't have to rush off to a show .\n- The $T$ is great and the prices are reasonable .\n- The $T$ is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .\n- Made my $T$ uncomfortable .\n- It also has lots of other $T$ that are affordable and just as yummy .\n- Apparently , the good $T$ works then .\n- Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .\n- Try the Times Square cocktail -- $T$ -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- Try the lobster teriyaki and the $T$ .\n- $T$ delicious !\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the $T$ was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- Best $T$ in NY !\n- good music , great food , speedy $T$ affordable prices .\n- Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked $T$ .\n- The $T$ is perfect .\n- Food was OK - $T$ was cooked well .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice $T$ in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .\n- The $T$ were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .\n- This particular location certainly uses substandard $T$ .\n- Why do people rave about the $T$ .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- For some reason , all the $T$ on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .\n- The $T$ here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\n- Good crowd , good $T$ , with a hip japanese vibe .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic $T$ in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable $T$ .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on $T$ .\n- Both a number of the $T$ and pasta specials were amazing .\n- Great Indian food and the $T$ is incredible .\n- This is a consistently great place to $T$ for lunch or dinner .\n- I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the $T$ of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .\n- Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of $T$ .\n- I think the $T$ is good .\n- Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much $T$ .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .\n- My husband had the mesclun , $T$ , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .\n- The only friendly staff member was the $T$ at the bar .\n- If it 's just a quick martini at the $T$ -LRB- which I recommend Jeffery 's -RRB- or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !\n- We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the $T$ disappointed .\n- Delicious $T$ at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .\n- However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the $T$ .\n- First the wrong bread came out with the $T$ , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the $T$ is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable $T$ , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the chilaquiles were awesome !\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ - all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- Being Puerto Rican I know a thing or two about $T$ and this place serves one of the best -LRB- I hope Mom does n't read this ! -RRB- .\n- Bottom line : B + for the $T$ , F for the service .\n- But they do n't have a $T$ , which is strange .\n- I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and $T$ with my date .\n- The ambiance is minimal the $T$ is not phenomenal , but some dishes are quite good , such as the eggplant parmesan , veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca .\n- Oh , and the complimentary $T$ was just enough - yummy !\n- His $T$ is excellent -LRB- and not expensive by NYC standards - no entrees over $ 30 , most appetizers $ 12 to 14 -RRB- .\n- I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and $T$ !\n- Authentic $T$ and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- It takes forever to get a $T$ and they almost always forget to bring something -LRB- although they dont forget to charge you for it .\n- The $T$ have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .\n- We did n't get drink refills and she did n't even offer us the option of $T$ .\n- Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and $T$ .\n- Monday nights are a bargain at the $ 28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus * three * glasses of wine paired with each $T$ .\n- Our first time in New York and we had to try a $T$ .\n- Every $T$ and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .\n- I do n't know about you guys , but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the $T$ not for the atmosphere .\n- We love the $T$ , drinks , and atmosphere !\n- My son and his girlfriend both wanted $T$ and they were huge !\n- A great choice at any $T$ and a great deal .\n- In addition , the $T$ is very good and the prices are reasonable .\n- but for the $T$ , it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group .\n- This place is worth going even if only for their $T$ .\n- The $T$ was authentic .\n- They also have a great assortment of wraps if your not in the mood for $T$ .\n- I always find myself asking the $T$ to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .\n- If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good $T$ , definitely visit Curry Leaf .\n- I 've had the chicken with garlic sauce , $T$ , and hunan chicken .\n- The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the $T$ of the dish .\n- The $T$ is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .\n- I love $T$ and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .\n- Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired ` doneness ' accompanied by $T$ and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the $T$ was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- The $T$ itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables , but the service could have been better .\n- A restaurant that does n't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant $T$ .\n- Young neighborhood trendies graze at the $T$ during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .\n- We did n't even see a menu , as our $T$ described both the specials and the main dishes .\n- You will pay a lot for the decore , but the $T$ is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY .\n- And the $T$ , well the food will keep you coming back .\n- I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the $T$ and dhal were kinda dissapointing .\n- The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the $T$ consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .\n- The food was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price -LRB- including 2 $T$ , $ 100/person -RRB- ...\n- I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their $T$ has slightly slipped in quality , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .\n- Creamy appetizers -- $T$ , eggplant salad , and Greek yogurt -LRB- with cuccumber , dill , and garlic -RRB- taste excellent when on warm pitas .\n- They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , $T$ and etc. .\n- The $T$ and panini 's are so yummy !\n- The $T$ here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .\n- Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , pizza etc , but their $T$ are out of this world !\n- The owners and $T$ are friendly and their pizza is fantastic .\n- Someone else recommended the $T$ -

not worth the $T$ .\n- Great food at reasonable $T$ .\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- We took advanatage of the $T$ on saturday so it was well worth it .\n- Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their $T$ are so cheap !\n- Not worth the $T$ .\n- The only fallback on this restaurant is the $T$ .\n- Most importantly , it is reasonably $T$ .\n- Could have had better for 1/3 the $T$ in Chinatown .\n- Moderate $T$ .\n- Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out $T$ are different .\n- Acceptable $T$ .\n- A Thai restaurant out of $T$ during dinner ?\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly $T$ wine that was n't as good .\n- Drinks way over $T$ .\n- But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the $T$ of the food is really cheap for the service you get .\n- Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the $T$ , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- Otherwise , this place has great service and $T$ and a nice friendly atmosphere .\n- While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with $T$ and 2-3 entrees .\n- For the location , the $T$ are very reasonable .\n- I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio -LRB- the Godfather -RRB- has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal $T$ .\n- It is also extremely well $T$ .\n- The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low $T$ .\n- Reasonably $T$ with very fresh sushi .\n- -RRB- It 's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village , but it 's a pretty solid one for its modest $T$ , and worth repeat visits .\n- And the $T$ were way to high for what you get .\n- The food is okay and the $T$ here are mediocre .\n- Great food at REASONABLE $T$ , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !\n- We took advanatage of the $T$ on saturday so it was well worth it .\n- Much more reasonably $T$ too !\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- The fish was not fresh and the $T$ tasted old and stale .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their $T$ are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap $T$ .\n- My goodness , everything from the fish to the $T$ to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .\n- Not worth the $T$ .\n- Anyway , the food is good , the $T$ is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- $T$ at upper intermediate range .\n- The overall $T$ was very very expensive , something I did expect .\n- would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that $T$\n- But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the $T$ are a bit over the top .\n- Otherwise , this place has great service and $T$ and a nice friendly atmosphere .\n- The $T$ were fantastic .\n- The dim sum is delectable while the $T$ are quite easy on the wallet .\n- would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that $T$\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -

I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great $T$ , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .\n\n【グループB】\n- Casablanca servces delicious $T$ , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- Of course the reason its so packed is because the $T$ is so delicious !\n- Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the $T$ or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- Traditional French decour was pleasant though the $T$ was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\n- Entrees include classics like $T$ , fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana .\n- I went for restaurant week and ordered off the $T$\n- Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and $T$ .\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our $T$ , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- the $T$ was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .\n- night without a $T$ , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine $T$ .\n- night without a reservation , we had to wait at the $T$ for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- Favourites include : $T$ and the lamb .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the $T$ , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- $T$ is accomodating make sure you are satified .\n- When going out for a nice $T$ , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .\n- I ordered a $T$ and found that the chicken was extremely dry .\n- We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the $T$ e while I had the sashimi .\n- I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically $T$ !!!\n- Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in $T$ -- generous portions .\n- Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no $T$ , kind of quiet .\n- During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and $T$ changed and it was not for the better .\n- By far the best salad I have had in a $T$ restaurant .\n- we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering $T$ .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , $T$ , quality and quantity .\n- We recently spent New Year 's Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the $T$ .\n- '' The menu includes pub fare -- burgers , $T$ and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as `` vegetarians .\n- I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago , I was in your $T$ .\n- What an amazing $T$ and experience !\n- The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no $T$ at all .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the $T$ was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my $T$ ot incoming guests .\n- The $T$ is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .\n- The staff was too busy ordering $T$ for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .\n- Could be pricey without a $T$ .\n- The waiters and $T$ were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .\n- The $T$ is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .\n- Favourites include : potato spinach gnocchi and the $T$ .\n- However , the $T$ is absolutely horrible .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- being a fan of $T$ , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .\n- Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in $T$ for $ 3.00 in NYC .\n- And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and $T$ !\n- I got an excellent piece of $T$ and we had several other nice pastries .\n- An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion -LRB- and kitchen 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the $T$ and soups .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family $T$ .\n- The $T$ is excellent .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled $T$ over it -LRB- the sauce was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- I noted it was crossed off on the $T$ .\n- What came to our $T$ was burned beyond recognition and stringy .\n- Here 's to the fake $T$ too ...\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great $T$ .\n- The $T$ here is only so-so .\n- The $T$ was huge .\n- Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your $T$ .\n- I had the $T$ and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few $T$ and enjoy our surroundings and each other .\n- The food is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the $T$ are really good .\n- Great wine selection , $T$ is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- The $T$ is an asbolute steal .\n- Not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the $T$ !\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one $T$ and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- The $T$ had an average portion , and was decent overall .\n- The rice was poor quality and was $T$ so badly it was hard .\n- The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , $T$ keep the palate from stagnating .\n- $T$ Waldy 's always measures up .\n- Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of $T$ of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .\n- They did n't give us the $T$ until we asked for it .\n- Try the $T$ and the rose special roll .\n- I would have gotten some cole slaw and a $T$ if my stomach had more space .\n- We had the $T$ and it was FANTASTIC .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- The bartenders and the $T$ are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .\n- After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me $T$ so I could eat my pie .\n- We could not catch our $T$ 's eye , and he ignored us .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- This is the perfect $T$ for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour $T$ from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .\n- Authentic $T$ .\n- Not impressed with the $T$ .\n- Delicate $T$ , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .\n- The food was just OK , at least for what $T$ was available .\n- If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly $T$ and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with $T$ bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !\n- My daughter and I left feeling satisfied -LRB- not stuffed -RRB- and it felt good to know we had a healthy $T$ .\n- I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious $T$ lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .\n- No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our $T$ .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- And forget what you read under me , the $T$ is n't that bad either .\n- The $T$ are also reasonably priced for NYC .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of $T$ .\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of $T$ , gratis .\n- The $T$ should not be overlooked !\n- I have $T$ about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- Horrible $T$ and Horrible service .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - $T$ - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The $T$ is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .\n- My friends and I experienced amazing $T$ and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .\n- Also a little more expensive than your average $T$ place .\n- The staff was very attentive , the $T$ lovely , and the food superb .\n- Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday $T$ here could n't be happier .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh $T$ .\n- still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were $T$ eventhough they were there much longer ...\n- For all of you new to $T$ , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .\n- The $T$ in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- They have some great $T$ here as well .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary $T$ .\n- The one vegetarian entree -LRB- Abby 's treasure -RRB- was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had $T$ covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .\n- We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent $T$ , which was generous , I feel .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- If you are here as a $T$ , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .\n- Try the $T$ -- ginger lemonade with vodka -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the $T$ has been overhauled .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a $T$ .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the $T$ .\n- It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the $T$ is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\n- $ 20 for all you can eat $T$ can not be beaten .\n- The $T$ and servers are personable and caring .\n- I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud $T$ till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a $T$ , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Great $T$ , lots of people .\n- We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful $T$ experience !!!\n- We were planning to get dessert but the $T$ basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .\n- Our waiter was fine , the $T$ looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .\n- But the $T$ was good .\n- The $T$ is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\n- Tasty steak , $T$ , the works .\n- I had the cod with paella -LRB- spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half -RRB- while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips -LRB- again , a big $T$ - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries -RRB- .\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of $T$ .\n- Casablanca servces delicious falafel , $T$ , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- The $T$ arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , $T$ to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- $T$ and Hostess was quite rude .\n- The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate $T$ !\n- Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass $T$ .\n- Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite $T$ .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , $T$ was great and the food was excellent !\n- I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the $T$ was freindly and knowledgable .\n- Great $T$ at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and $T$ was poor .\n- at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the $T$ are manna from heaven .\n- Simple $T$ and what hot and lage portions .\n- The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested $T$ for my husband he enjoyed his meal .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant $T$ there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a $T$ at the bar .\n- Whether your choose the $T$ or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the $T$ here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .\n- My goodness , everything from the $T$ to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .\n- The $T$ came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful $T$ .\n- We had a party in their $T$ and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent $T$ and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .\n- When the $T$ arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .\n- I ordered $T$ and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .\n- Plus they made a perfect $T$ .\n- The waiters were not attentive except that the $T$ turned up on the table before we were finished .\n- I would like to return and try some of the other $T$ when I do n't have to rush off to a show .\n- The $T$ is great and the prices are reasonable .\n- The $T$ is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .\n- Made my $T$ uncomfortable .\n- It also has lots of other $T$ that are affordable and just as yummy .\n- Apparently , the good $T$ works then .\n- Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .\n- Try the Times Square cocktail -- $T$ -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- Try the lobster teriyaki and the $T$ .\n- $T$ delicious !\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the $T$ was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- Best $T$ in NY !\n- good music , great food , speedy $T$ affordable prices .\n- Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked $T$ .\n- The $T$ is perfect .\n- Food was OK - $T$ was cooked well .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice $T$ in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .\n- The $T$ were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .\n- This particular location certainly uses substandard $T$ .\n- Why do people rave about the $T$ .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- For some reason , all the $T$ on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .\n- The $T$ here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\n- Good crowd , good $T$ , with a hip japanese vibe .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic $T$ in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable $T$ .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on $T$ .\n- Both a number of the $T$ and pasta specials were amazing .\n- Great Indian food and the $T$ is incredible .\n- This is a consistently great place to $T$ for lunch or dinner .\n- I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the $T$ of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .\n- Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of $T$ .\n- I think the $T$ is good .\n- Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much $T$ .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .\n- My husband had the mesclun , $T$ , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .\n- The only friendly staff member was the $T$ at the bar .\n- If it 's just a quick martini at the $T$ -LRB- which I recommend Jeffery 's -RRB- or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !\n- We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the $T$ disappointed .\n- Delicious $T$ at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .\n- However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the $T$ .\n- First the wrong bread came out with the $T$ , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the $T$ is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable $T$ , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the chilaquiles were awesome !\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ -
