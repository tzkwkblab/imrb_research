-RRB- has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal $T$ .\n- They have authentic Indian at amazin $T$ .\n- The new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of

Moules were excellent , $T$ was VERY salty !\n- $T$ was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\n-

atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .\n- I 've had to wait only a few times during $T$ but this place is definitely worth the wait .\n- This was n't the expected $T$ comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .\n- i would just ask for no $T$ next time .\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our $T$ , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find $T$ you .\n- I 've been to Naples 45 for $T$ twice .\n- Try the spicy wontons and the $T$ .\n- $T$ - awesome .\n- I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is

.\n- Patroon features a nice $T$ and has great staff .\n- The $T$ was n't for us , though .\n- good music , great food , speedy $T$ affordable prices .\n- This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate $T$ with business associates .\n- The tuna and $T$ are excellent .\n- For authentic $T$ , look no further than Toons .\n- They sell special sushi , everything have a $T$ , sauce and etc. .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the $T$ and the service was .\n- Creative dishes like $T$ and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu .\n- The $T$ was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .\n- Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an $T$ .\n- As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out

she replied back rice and just walked away .\n- Upon entering , we were greeted by the $T$ , Steven and Frederick , who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts .\n- I think the $T$ is good .\n- After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away -LRB- we had n't even looked at it yet , we had full beers yet to drink -RRB- , the manager approached and told us they needed the table for

great .\n- We were looking forward to nice $T$ when we arrived .\n- The $T$ was the friendliest that have seen in New York .\n- However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the $T$ .\n- But after last night , Spice Grill is the only place I 'm eating $T$ .\n- but when we looked at the menu , there were n't a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the $T$ section .\n- My husband had the mesclun , salmon , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 $T$ .\n- You must try Odessa stew or $T$ ; salads-all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- The pasta primavera was outstanding as well , lots of $T$ .\n- Fast $T$ .\n- $ 20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality - I

place to sit down , have a drink and conversations with friends , go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and $T$ .\n- Only $T$ and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .\n- My Chelsea 's impressive and creative menu includes modern , Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean , Jap style hamburger steak , spicy cod roe spaghetti , $T$ , and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce , to name a few .\n- We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the $T$ was wonderful .\n- Also , top the $T$ with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu .\n- Probably much busier for $T$ , it 's seldom crowded for dinner -LRB- too close to downtown -RRB- .\n- Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken -LRB- usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both $T$ -RRB- .\n- Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good $T$ .\n- Luckily we saved room for the $T$ , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .\n- I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village , and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in $T$ , I have been hesitant to be disloyal .\n- $T$ was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .\n- Delicious $T$ too .\n- Kind of a small $T$ but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .\n- We all ate $T$ , which were great .\n- The $T$ and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .\n- The $T$ was very good , a great deal , and the place its self was great .\n- The best thing I tasted were the $T$ .\n- Give it a try , $T$ is typical French but varied .\n- Grilled whole $T$ wonderful , great spicing .\n- There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the $T$ have MAJOR attitude .\n- I come from a family of pizzeria owners , and I 'm almost ashamed to say that the $T$ in Fornino 's blows my families receipies away .\n- They also have a great $T$ if your not in the mood for traditional Mediterranean fare .\n- Thick fries , meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a $T$ that includes a cool , ultra-thick chocolate Frosty .\n- If you 're looking to taste some great $T$ and want good service , definitely visit Curry Leaf .\n- Interesting other $T$ for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole .\n- The $T$ has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .\n- A cheap eat for NYC , but not for $T$ .\n- Even if the food was n't this good , the $T$ is a great place to sit outside and relax .\n- If you love wine and cheese and delicious $T$ , you 'll love Artisanal !\n- The $T$ is great .\n- This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart 's and I must say how delicous the food and the $T$ was .\n- $T$ and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .\n- This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having $T$ , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- Stick to the items the place does best , brisket , ribs , wings , $T$ is good , not great .\n- The $T$ that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .\n- The well mannered , pleasant $T$ that Tony has in his employ .\n- The food is great , I love their dumplings , cold sesame noodles , $T$ and shrimp dishs .\n- The $T$ makes you feel at home , the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL !\n- Had 1 appetizer , 2 entrees and 2 $T$ and the bill was ~ $ 55.00 , not including tip .\n- The $T$ was definitely good , but when all was said and done , I just could n't justify it for the price -LRB- including 2 drinks , $ 100/person -RRB- ...\n- The highly spiced $T$ was great too .\n- $T$ -- taramasalata , eggplant salad , and Greek yogurt -LRB- with cuccumber , dill , and garlic -RRB- taste excellent when on warm pitas .\n- And , atlhough $T$ opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .\n- My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large $T$ .\n- The service is descent even when this small $T$ is packed .\n- Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , $T$ etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !\n- The $T$ is sleek , modern and playfull and i will return again frequently .\n- A must for all the $T$ lovers .\n- I highly reccomend the $T$ , it 's insanely good .\n- The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous $T$ is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\n- Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked $T$ !\n- Anytime and everytime I find myself in the neighborhood I will go to Sushi Rose for fresh sushi and great $T$ all at a reasonable price .\n- Oh yes , and they lie on the phone , claiming they have seating in the garden , then of course the $T$ are not available .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced $T$ with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- Favourites include : potato spinach gnocchi and the $T$ .\n- Service is friendly , prices are good - $T$ was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .\n- I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their $T$ .\n- In mi burrito , here was nothing but dark $T$ that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste .\n- I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice $T$ .\n- The service was a bit slow and the $T$ are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .\n- Speedy delivers , great food , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable $T$ .\n- Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special $T$ .\n- The bartenders and the managers are really nice and the $T$ is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .\n- While there are plenty of places to go for a good $T$ , Katz 's has a charm about it .\n- Always great $T$ !\n- The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their $T$ .\n- The design and $T$ is just as good .\n- The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one $T$ a better baked ziti with meatsauce .\n- I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE $T$ .\n- The $T$ is pleasant , fun , and for the most part gorgeous -LRB- in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way , not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way -RRB- .\n- I do suggest to ask to be seated $T$ if you are looking to be a little cozy .\n- The $T$ was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .\n- $ 160 for 2 $T$ , 2 sides , an appetizer and drinks .\n- I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic $T$ on the blackboard .\n- The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef -LRB- usually with a little fresh wasabi and $T$ but also sometimes with some sea salt -RRB- .\n- The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the $T$ or not .\n- The $T$ is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .\n- Been to the one in Brooklyn for over 25 years , now I dont have to go over the bridge for the best $T$ ... Hanx\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the $T$ showed up at the end of the meal .\n- $T$ was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .\n- I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of $T$ .\n- While the $T$ are a little big for me , the fresh juices are the best I have ever had !\n- By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and $T$ .\n- the two $T$ looked like they had been sucking on lemons .\n- The $T$ was loud and inconsiderate .\n- After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties -LRB- multiples of 2 and higher -RRB- seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small $T$ .\n- For $T$ , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .\n- The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any $T$ allergies or food you do n't like .\n- Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more $T$ and smaller so that each dish is cheap .\n- This big draw is the all you can $T$ here for $ 19.95 !\n- The photobook $T$ was a cute touch , certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken , pork chop , and noodle dishes that we all ordered .\n- The duck confit is always amazing and the $T$ was out of this world .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the $T$ .\n- Food was average and $T$ was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .\n- The food 's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate , truly embracing the beauty of authentic $T$ .\n- Spice is great Thai food , love the inexpensive $T$ .\n- Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked $T$ .\n- This bar has it all -
