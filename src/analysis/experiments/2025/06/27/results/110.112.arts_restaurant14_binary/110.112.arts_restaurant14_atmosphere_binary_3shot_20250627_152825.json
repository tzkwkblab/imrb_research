the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Sake collection was excellent -LRB- Try $T$ -RRB- , but pricy .\n- The $T$ was good .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of $T$ overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- The $T$ were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad .\n- The service was excellent and the $T$ was delicious .\n- I 've eaten at all three locations and I always love , love the food , the $T$ is always wonderful and the prices are really reasonable .\n- The $T$ is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .\n- The $T$ was actually aweful .\n- If you love seafood , you would love this $T$ !\n- Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their $T$ .\n- It 's charmingly small and that leads to an $T$ that is extremely cozy and romantic , even .\n- my picks : Guizhou chicken , $T$ , fish fillet in spicy source -LRB- special menu -RRB- .\n- Based on the reviews for $T$ , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .\n- I ordered the $T$ and it was off flavor .\n- $T$ and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ however was very good .\n- Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his $T$ , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- Yes , they use fancy $T$ , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .\n- The $T$ came by to pick up the soy sauce WHILE we were eating our lunch !!!!!\n- We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , $T$ , and service .\n- The $T$ were pretty good .\n- The $T$ was attentive .\n- This $T$ is the most Japanese it can ever get .\n- $T$ was also very good .\n- They have a very good $T$ and good tuna as well .\n- The $T$ , however , was a bright flower in a garden .\n- The food was mediocre and the $T$ was severely slow .\n- Great $T$ , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- They have authentic $T$ at amazin prices .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters -

you come for the authentic $T$ , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the $T$ .\n- Best of all is the warm $T$ , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .\n- Drawbacks : $T$ is slow and they do n't toast !\n- The one positive thing I can say is that the service was prompt , we got seated right away and the $T$ was very friendly .\n- The $T$ was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- We had $T$ at 9pm , but was not seated until 10:15 pm .\n- They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the $T$ is consistent .\n- The $T$ was good , the service prompt , and the price very reasonable .\n- If it is n't for the food -LRB- A + + + -RRB- , it must be the $T$ or the ambience .\n- The $T$ is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , $T$ , choice , quality and quantity .\n- Food is excellent quality for a good restaurant $T$ .\n- Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza , the $T$ , and a good bottle of wine .\n- If you like $T$ get the chicken vindaloo .\n- Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the $T$ brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .\n- Aside from the $T$ , the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail , Boton Shrimp , Blue Fin Torro -LRB- Fatty Tuna -RRB- , Sea Eel , etc. .\n- The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the $T$ magnificant .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- The food is great , I love their dumplings , $T$ , chicken and shrimp dishs .\n- A great choice at any $T$ and a great deal .\n- This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , $T$ , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- my picks are : - $T$ -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the $T$ was practically empty .\n- The $T$ was sweet and luscious .\n- You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind , Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful $T$ .\n- Oh , but wait , we were out of $T$ -LRB- which were also delightfully overpriced -RRB- .\n- Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table -LRB- even though we had $T$ -RRB- .\n- From beginning appetizers , the scallops were incredible , to the delicious $T$ , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- The $T$ is courteous and friendly .\n- The $T$ is so cheap , but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere .\n- We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the $T$ was wonderful .\n- Authentic food and they have REAL $T$ , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- We started with the scallops and asparagus and also had the soft shell crab as well as the $T$ .\n- It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded $T$ at dinnertime .\n- At peak times , the restaurant is overcrowded and $T$ are uncomfortably close .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the $T$ was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .\n- The $T$ are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .\n- My chicken was completely dried out and on the cold side and the $T$ was not very flavorful .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- And the $T$ was outragous .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the $T$ were !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland $T$ - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- The $T$ is great and authentic .\n- Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the $T$ you pay for them .\n- The $T$ and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming $T$ filled with candles and family pictures .\n- As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to $T$ .\n- Not only was the $T$ fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the duck !\n- The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the $T$ were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -LRB- not iceberg -RRB- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .\n- While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and $T$ could have been a lot better .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome $T$ and Hibiscus lemonade .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- The $T$ itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .\n- The only friendly $T$ was the guy at the bar .\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ - all good ; and kompot is soo refreshing during the hot summer day -LRB- they make it the way my mom does , reminds me of home a lot -RRB- .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- This is such a lovely , peaceful $T$ to eat outside .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- The food is great -LRB- big $T$ , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- My host asked for appetizers for the group and the $T$ gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- It is kinda nosiy and the $T$ are close together but it 's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the $T$ , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- My entree of $T$ was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .\n- I love the drinks , esp $T$ , and the food is also VERY good .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have $T$ , especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable staff , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the $T$ were awesome !\n- Good $T$ and good cream cheese .\n- I had the salmon dish and while it was fine , for the price paid , I expected it to have some type of $T$ .\n- Good service , great food , good value , and never have to $T$ in line !\n- And , atlhough $T$ opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space , they left us awkardly seated .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good $T$ and bad service .\n- They have $T$ made with really fresh and yummy ingredients .\n- The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the $T$ is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting $T$ and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .\n- I am not sure if I would call the $T$ here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .\n- Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the $T$ .\n- Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , $T$ , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...\n- Of course this atmosphere is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour $T$ place anyways ?\n- I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the $T$ are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- The $T$ is great , with a good selection , and everything that I have tried is absolutely delicious .\n- Make sure you have the $T$ . . .\n- The $T$ is awful -- the last time I was there -LRB- and I do mean the last time -RRB- we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave .\n- It is a lot of fun with $T$ and all kinds of Disney type special effects .\n- The $T$ is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the drinks are really good .\n- And the $T$ is also young , energeic and hot !!!!\n- The Sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people , but I did n't like the fact they used $T$ .\n- Fluke sashimi drizzled with $T$ , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .\n- The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the $T$ industry , I understood they were busy .\n- Great food , good wine and an excellent $T$ .\n- We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and $T$ asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .\n- Although the restaurant itself is nice , I prefer not to go for the $T$ .\n- Everyone who works there -LRB- the $T$ , the bartender , the servers -RRB- is so helpful .\n- Great $T$ .\n- I go back in $T$ like three times on average until I ca n't walk anymore .\n- This $T$ is asian-air fusion .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ there is very attentive and down to earth .\n- This $T$ has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\n- $T$ is very accomodating .\n- Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ' $T$ ' were great .\n- My daughter and I left feeling satisfied -LRB- not stuffed -RRB- and it felt good to know we had a healthy $T$ .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- The $T$ is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .\n- The $T$ is zesty and flavorful and the crust is nice and crispy .\n- I ordered the $T$ and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .\n- The host -LRB- owner -RRB- and $T$ are personable and caring .\n- $T$ are always friendly .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great $T$ .\n- You can even get packages of the $T$ to stock your fridge !\n- The bread and $T$ I had before the meal were quite good , however .\n- While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on $T$ in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .\n- The owners and employees are friendly and their $T$ is fantastic .\n- It wo n't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the $T$ .\n- It 's about $ 7 for lunch and they have $T$ or dine-in .\n- When you 're sitting in their main dining room -LRB- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high $T$ -RRB- you 'd never know there was a world outside .\n- Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the $T$ was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .\n- But the $T$ is way to expensive .\n- This $T$ has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .\n- So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their $T$ .\n- Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the $T$ who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .\n- $T$ is so very fresh .\n- The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of $T$ I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .\n- Cute $T$ , nice wait staff but would never go there again .\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- Aside from the rushed service , we were very impressed with the $T$ and the drinks .\n- The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the $T$ huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .\n- $T$ is nice and minimalist , food simple yet very well presented and cooked , and the wine list matches the food very well .\n- I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the $T$ fine cuisine , even with no idea how to use them .\n- It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty $T$ , but standing up was n't too bad .\n- $T$ is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !\n- The ` kamasutra ' and ' $T$ ' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time .\n- Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great $T$ and has great food !\n- A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty $T$ at dirt-cheap prices .\n- I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the $T$ and the great staff at La Lanterna .\n- The $T$ covers a wide variety without being imposeing .\n- Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill $T$ .\n- It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out $T$ , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .\n- INCREDIBLY POOR $T$ AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .\n- The $T$ is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .\n- BUt their best dish is thh $T$ - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , $T$ , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Immediately after we paid , the $T$ took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .\n- I would like to return and try some of the other $T$ when I do n't have to rush off to a show .\n- And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our $T$ by knocking over a glass of water .\n- They offer the same $T$ but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .\n- Best $T$ I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .\n- Lunch came with $T$ , no extra charge .\n- The fish was not fresh and the $T$ tasted old and stale .\n- I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the $T$ and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .\n- I must warn the reader that the $T$ sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .\n- The $T$ is very good and the service is great .\n- Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $ 12 - $ 15 per $T$ , I 'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat !\n- Kosher dills are the perfect compliment for your unforgetable $T$ and they give you plenty of them .\n- Given the incredible $T$ surrounding it , this place has no character .\n- My vegetable risotto was burnt , and infused totally in a burnt $T$ .\n- $T$ was awful -
