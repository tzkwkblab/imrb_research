was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .\n- The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt $T$ .\n- The $T$ was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .\n- The $T$ is ok but could be better .\n- Rao 's has the best $T$ and atmosphere in NYC .\n- The food , drinks and $T$ are clearly among the best in the city .\n- The $T$ is excellent and always informative without an air .\n- The $T$ was excellent and the food was delicious .\n- I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly $T$ to a 15 person party .\n- We 've always gotten amazing $T$ and we love the food .\n- Fabulous $T$ , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .\n- mojitos and the $T$ are the best part in there\n- Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great $T$ .\n- $T$ was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .\n- The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the $T$ industry , I understood they were busy .\n- not the food , not the ambiance , not the $T$ , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .\n- For the people who want great food plus great $T$ , Roxy is a place to AVOID !\n- Good $T$ , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- It was pleasantly uncrowded , the $T$ was delightful , the garden adorable , the food -LRB- from appetizers to entrees -RRB- was delectable .\n- While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service -LRB- waiter was not quite competent and SLOW $T$ -RRB- and lack of remorse .\n- I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the $T$ and the great staff at La Lanterna .\n- To be fair , the food still is good and the $T$ is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy .\n- The food really is n't very good and the $T$ is terrible .\n- Bottom line : B + for the food , F for the $T$ .\n- The waitresses are nice -- also you can just get $T$ sit .\n- Food and $T$ was okay .\n- If you 're looking to taste some great Indian food and want good $T$ , definitely visit Curry Leaf .\n- The environment is romantic , but the food is horrible , the $T$ is pathetic , and gabriella lies about everything she could .\n- A very inviting restaurant , with friendly $T$ .\n- And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and $T$ !\n- Great food , good size menu , great $T$ and an unpretensious setting .\n- Good , fast $T$ .\n- This place is classy , chic , the $T$ is warm and hospitable , and the food is outstanding .\n- The $T$ was mediocre , and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal .\n- good music , great food , speedy $T$ affordable prices .\n- We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the $T$ was very quick and professional .\n- The food was amazing , the $T$ was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !\n- There is no excuse for such lousy $T$ !\n- I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL -LRB- OR BAD $T$ -RRB- @ PIGALLE .\n- The $T$ was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .\n- The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the $T$ or the atmosphere .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , food-quality and $T$ overcompensate .\n- Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the $T$ directory .\n- The blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the $T$ is great .\n- I 've never had bad $T$ and the fish is fresh and delicious .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- While the food was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the $T$ was horrendous .\n- they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the $T$ was horrible .\n- The $T$ was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .\n- A con was the slow $T$ .\n- $T$ could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -LRB- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -RRB- in the restaurant experience .\n- Horrible food and Horrible $T$ .\n- Turned out there was full $T$ upstairs and sat down .\n- Even when the chef is not in the house , the food and $T$ are right on target .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent $T$ , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush , this is not the place for you .\n\n【グループB】\n- Ive asked a $T$ for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .\n- We had a great tiem watching the shows and $T$ and ar food was just what we were looking for .\n- Once for $T$ and once for brunch .\n- I was on jury duty , rode my bike up Centre Street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and $T$ .\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- Good , because hey , it 's more $T$ , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .\n- Try the $T$ -LRB- not on menu -RRB- .\n- I do n't like $T$ too much and this was delicious , however you want to factor that into the equation .\n- The $T$ is so cheap and the waiters are nice .\n- The main draw of this place is the $T$ .\n- Highly recommend this as great value for excellent $T$ and service .\n- The wine and $T$ plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .\n- The $T$ had a nice selection .\n- The only weird thing was if we got a $T$ , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent service , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable $T$ , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- I WAS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE $T$ .\n- We went here for $T$ a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .\n- The $T$ were cold in the middle and the buns were stale .\n- All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always good , the tapas are always yummy , especially with the warm pita bread .\n- I liked the food at this $T$ restaurant .\n- The $T$ is average and the prices are anything but .\n- The chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with $T$ .\n- The food was great - sushi was good , but the $T$ amazed us .\n- The best thing I tasted were the $T$ .\n- $T$ came with pickels and slaw , no extra charge .\n- The $T$ was absolutely amazing !!\n- I never had an $T$ before so I gave it a shot .\n- We began with the $T$ -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and kielbasa to dip .\n- Dug the $T$ too .\n- From beginning appetizers , the $T$ were incredible , to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet , we were delighted by the taste sensations .\n- do n't get me wrong - $T$ was good , just not fantastic .\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our $T$ and each other .\n- The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other $T$ , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -LRB- avocado shrimp -RRB- were quite good .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring $T$ or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the $T$ sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !\n- For the $T$ , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .\n- The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the $T$ down , rushing you out .\n- The $T$ are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .\n- The waiters are sweet , the $T$ is tasty and the bill is never too large .\n- We wo n't go to this place again for a good $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the $T$ intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat -RRB- .\n- Some $T$ get their wish .\n- The $T$ is good .\n- The $T$ is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .\n- great $T$ , good times .\n- Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out $T$ and environment .\n- If your looking for nasty high priced $T$ with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap BX A$ $ this is the place to be !!\n- $T$ tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .\n- I choose to go with one of the $T$ , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .\n- Even better , they know how to cook French classics like $T$ and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .\n- Good $T$ at the restaurant -LRB- a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date -RRB- .\n- The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the $T$ were stale .\n- The $T$ 's - watered down .\n- Haru serves very fresh $T$ , has a trendy , modern ambiance , prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service .\n- $T$ was n't anything spectacular for the price .\n- The $T$ has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher ! 2 for 1 's .\n- Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good $T$ at a fair price .\n- The duck confit is always amazing and the $T$ was out of this world .\n- From the appetizers we ate , the dim sum and other variety of $T$ , it was impossible to criticize the food .\n- This place has realy fresh $T$ and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine .\n- To begin , we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave , when the $T$ offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready .\n- The staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the $T$ is lovely .\n- I have been here a few times for dinner , once for $T$ and twice for lunch .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- $T$ was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .\n- After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have $T$ .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous $T$ is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .\n- Whenever you need a $T$ , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .\n- The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the $T$ to any food allergies or food you do n't like .\n- We were so happy with our $T$ and were even more thrilled when we saw the bill .\n- $T$ was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- I 've never had bad service and the $T$ is fresh and delicious .\n- The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for $T$ and even less for lunch .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my $T$ .\n- $T$ - have you ever in your life heard of anything so ridiculously wonderful ?\n- Anyway , the $T$ was fake .\n- Here you get the $T$ without feeling rigid .\n- Although be warned their $T$ and take out prices are different .\n- Our $T$ was helpful and charming , the food was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance , and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City , the $T$ was not what I had hoped for .\n- The $T$ are very large and the service is fantastic !!\n- I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the $T$ .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the $T$ -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was wonderful and imaginative .\n- If you love $T$ and cheese and delicious french fare , you 'll love Artisanal !\n- The bread is the soft paratha bread -LRB- unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta -RRB- , and the $T$ is tandoori styled and very flavorful .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a $T$ and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- $T$ , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- I had $T$ it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .\n- THE $T$ ARE REALLY LARGE .\n- The $T$ is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service .\n- We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the $T$ .\n- the $T$ was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining .\n- Great $T$ experience .\n- $T$ are somewhere around $ 7 each and the main dishes are between $ 11 and $ 16 .\n- $T$ are rude bit again it 's new york !\n- I found the variety of the $T$ to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- The $T$ is clean , and if you like soul food , then this is the place to be !\n- Glechik might be way too tiny for a restaurant by Russian standards , but it is cozy and the $T$ is simply GREAT .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential $T$ -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the $T$ is excellent too .\n- the food - not worth the $T$ .\n- The $T$ are nice -- also you can just get counter service sit .\n- $T$ were excellent in addition to appetizers and main courses .\n- Our waiter was helpful and charming , the $T$ was perfect , and the wine was good , too .\n- From the complimentary $T$ of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .\n- We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria , but facing away from the $T$ when we turned back around , the $ 2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it .\n- The $T$ are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .\n- their $T$ are fantastic .\n- First walking in the place seemed to have great $T$ .\n- The $T$ at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 !\n- Best things to order are from the grill -LRB- Churrasco and $T$ -RRB- .\n- With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the $T$ here was decent , not great .\n- at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the $T$ playing in the background is also voluminous .\n- I think I 've had some the best $T$ of my life at minnow .\n- A Thai restaurant out of $T$ during dinner ?\n- The last time I went we were seated at a $T$ in a corridor next to the kitchen .\n- Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however $T$ or other sauce would have done much to enhance .\n- Its $T$ is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- $T$ is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .\n- Quite frankly , this is some of the worst $T$ I have ever tried .\n- Too bad the $T$ was n't of the same heritage .\n- $T$ are the perfect size for those hungry nights .\n- We ordered a $T$ and were finished eating and paying before the wine came .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like $T$ or a side .\n- Reasonable $T$ .\n- I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent $T$ experience .\n- I also recommend the $T$ or the different varieties of congee -LRB- rice porridge -RRB- .\n- The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold $T$ to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- The main course had an average $T$ , and was decent overall .\n- First the wrong $T$ came out with the appetizer , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...\n- The service was friendly and the $T$ was casual .\n- Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty $T$ guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .\n- The food is top notch , the service is attentive , and the $T$ is great .\n- Also , specify if you like your $T$ spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .\n- In reality -LRB- to maximize potential diners -RRB- they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating $T$ of those waiting in the lobby .\n- Succulent $T$ cooked precisely to your desired ` doneness ' accompanied by salads and sides that do n't look like leafy road kill .\n- Would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour $T$ , when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes , the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for ?\n- We even had a visit from the $T$ who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .\n- The $T$ give you some sample slices of your order while you wait -LRB- shortly I might add -RRB- .\n- But they do n't have a $T$ , which is strange .\n- Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this $T$ , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly $T$ wine that was n't as good .\n- The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had -LRB- I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the $T$ of the meat -RRB- .\n- Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the $T$ is great .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- Great $T$ at reasonable prices .\n- They are $T$ with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch .\n- Build a $T$ with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .\n- BE CAREFUL before you request extra $T$ .\n- The first time I went , and was completely taken by the $T$ and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .\n- I love to visit Murrays for my $T$ fix .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious $T$ such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- The $T$ inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and samosa chaats , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- $T$ include flan and sopaipillas .\n- It is also extremely well $T$ .\n- The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the $T$ arrives .\n- Entrees include classics like lasagna , $T$ and chicken parmigiana .\n- Go for the $T$ .\n- The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex $T$ needs to be cleaned more often .\n- We started with lox and mussels -LRB- the best ive ever had , ever -RRB- and had the cod and $T$ for dinner .\n- $T$ was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -LRB- though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -RRB- .\n- The worst excuse for $T$ I 've ever encountered .\n- I went at 6:00 PM specifically for the pre-theater menu -LRB- $ 19.95 for $T$ , steak frites , creme brulee -RRB- and it was marvelous .\n- I would n't even have complained at all if the $T$ at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .\n- But the main hit was the $T$ .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- Service was good and so was the $T$ .\n- We always enjoy the $T$ .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- His wife Tanya , the $T$ , completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious .\n- In addition to great hot dogs , DOTP has wonderful $T$ that feature , in addition to great things like tator tots and English muffins , a delicious NJ-based pork product know to us Jersey girls and boys as Taylor ham .\n- We arrived for $T$ expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !\n- Do n't go alone -- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with $T$ and a selection of meats and seafoods .\n- The $T$ are ok , but the service is slow .\n- $T$ was a little soggy .\n- The menu changed , portions were even smaller than before , a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility , a basmati rice dish lacked $T$ .\n- The $T$ is great if your looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon .\n- The second you walk through the heavy vault like $T$ , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface , and you get platters of thin sliced meats , various vegetables , and $T$ and glass noodles .\n- The quail was fantastic and unique and the $T$ were full of flavor .\n- The service is outstanding and my $T$ could not have been better .\n- Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for $T$ , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .\n- If I could rate the $T$ this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .\n- word of advice , save room for $T$ and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .\n- the $T$ was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .\n- I 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the $T$ .\n- Fresh , authentic , $T$ in substantial portions .\n- but , the filet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free $T$ -LRB- nice non-sushi selection -RRB- .\n- The $T$ is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , $T$ , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- The wait staff is friendly , and the $T$ has gotten better and better !\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the $T$ , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- We could have made a $T$ of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .\n- The $T$ was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor .\n- the $T$ - not worth the price .\n- Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some $T$ lover 's brunch .\n- This particular location certainly uses substandard $T$ .\n- You should pass on the $T$ .\n- To my right , the $T$ stood over a busboy and hissed rapido , rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six .\n- If you like seafood and/or $T$ you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things .\n- This $T$ has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time .\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same $T$ that made Tiffin so attractive , the menu has been overhauled .\n- I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good $T$ .\n- For the $T$ , a little too expensive .\n- Food was good and the $T$ of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .\n- The closest that I got was the $T$ , but they were out of it that day .\n- Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not $T$ on them .\n- I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine $T$ , even with no idea how to use them .\n- Great $T$ and great cocktail menu .\n- $T$ drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil , the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish 's sweetness .\n- He takes real pride in his $T$ and his business .\n- I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and my husband got $T$ .\n- Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu , though - too much avocado and $T$ will fill you up right quick .\n- It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic $T$ .\n- We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added $T$ and kielbasa to dip .\n- Very nice touch that very much fits the $T$ .\n- The $T$ from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .\n- We did n't know if we should order a $T$ or leave ?\n- Way too much money for such a terrible $T$ .\n- I have to say I have never had a disapointing $T$ here .\n- We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there , sharing a large $T$ , a pizza of two of their specials , one was goat cheese the other blue cheese , and both were excellent .\n- good $T$ to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine .\n- MY date and I both ordered the $T$ and both felt the fish was very average .\n- Note that they do not serve $T$ , you must bring your own .\n- This is a consistently great place to $T$ for lunch or dinner .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a $T$ , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- delicious simple food in nice outdoor $T$ .\n- For $T$ I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .\n- The spicy $T$ is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .\n- I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of $T$ and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .\n- I choose to go with one of the special , the $T$ , which was excellent .\n- Definitely try the calamari , any pasta , or even the $T$ .\n- My host asked for $T$ for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered , but some other items that were not ordered .\n- We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and $T$ to dip .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- The food is all-around good , with the $T$ usually excellent and the sushi/sashimi not quite on the same level .\n- Of course this $T$ is lacking , but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways ?\n- The combination of fresh tomato sauce , fresh mozz cheese , basil and the $T$ they make
