not worth the $T$ .\n- Great food at reasonable $T$ .\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- We took advanatage of the $T$ on saturday so it was well worth it .\n- Try the Pad Thai , it 's fabulous and their $T$ are so cheap !\n- Not worth the $T$ .\n- The only fallback on this restaurant is the $T$ .\n- Most importantly , it is reasonably $T$ .\n- Could have had better for 1/3 the $T$ in Chinatown .\n- Moderate $T$ .\n- Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out $T$ are different .\n- Acceptable $T$ .\n- A Thai restaurant out of $T$ during dinner ?\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly $T$ wine that was n't as good .\n- Drinks way over $T$ .\n- But when you are seated the waitresses are great , they explain everything on the menu , and the $T$ of the food is really cheap for the service you get .\n- Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the $T$ , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- Otherwise , this place has great service and $T$ and a nice friendly atmosphere .\n- While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with $T$ and 2-3 entrees .\n- For the location , the $T$ are very reasonable .\n- I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio -LRB- the Godfather -RRB- has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal $T$ .\n- It is also extremely well $T$ .\n- The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low $T$ .\n- Reasonably $T$ with very fresh sushi .\n- -RRB- It 's not the best Japanese restaurant in the East Village , but it 's a pretty solid one for its modest $T$ , and worth repeat visits .\n- And the $T$ were way to high for what you get .\n- The food is okay and the $T$ here are mediocre .\n- Great food at REASONABLE $T$ , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !\n- We took advanatage of the $T$ on saturday so it was well worth it .\n- Much more reasonably $T$ too !\n- There are much better places in NY with better $T$ .\n- The fish was not fresh and the $T$ tasted old and stale .\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the $T$ - RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL .\n- Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their $T$ are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .\n- A mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow , barely there space for its quick , tasty treats at dirt-cheap $T$ .\n- My goodness , everything from the fish to the $T$ to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .\n- Not worth the $T$ .\n- Anyway , the food is good , the $T$ is right and they have a decent wine list .\n- $T$ at upper intermediate range .\n- The overall $T$ was very very expensive , something I did expect .\n- would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that $T$\n- But dinner here is never disappointing , even if the $T$ are a bit over the top .\n- Otherwise , this place has great service and $T$ and a nice friendly atmosphere .\n- The $T$ were fantastic .\n- The dim sum is delectable while the $T$ are quite easy on the wallet .\n- would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that $T$\n- They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -

I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great $T$ , great atmosphere , good service and a wonderful wine list .\n\n【グループB】\n- Casablanca servces delicious $T$ , tabouleh , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his $T$ , you 'll like it !\n- Of course the reason its so packed is because the $T$ is so delicious !\n- Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special $T$ .\n- Whether it 's the $T$ or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .\n- Traditional French decour was pleasant though the $T$ was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .\n- Entrees include classics like $T$ , fettuccine Alfredo and chicken parmigiana .\n- I went for restaurant week and ordered off the $T$\n- Other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and $T$ .\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our $T$ , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- the $T$ was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .\n- night without a $T$ , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine $T$ .\n- night without a reservation , we had to wait at the $T$ for a little while , but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- Favourites include : $T$ and the lamb .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the $T$ , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .\n- $T$ is accomodating make sure you are satified .\n- When going out for a nice $T$ , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .\n- I ordered a $T$ and found that the chicken was extremely dry .\n- We shared a bottle of sake , an order of edamames , and she had the $T$ e while I had the sashimi .\n- I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically $T$ !!!\n- Perfectly al dente pasta , not drowned in $T$ -- generous portions .\n- Great roofdeck , nice group of 30 somethings , but no $T$ , kind of quiet .\n- During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and $T$ changed and it was not for the better .\n- By far the best salad I have had in a $T$ restaurant .\n- we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant , then we sat down to begin ordering $T$ .\n- On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , $T$ , quality and quantity .\n- We recently spent New Year 's Eve at the restaurant , and had a great experience , from the wine to the $T$ .\n- '' The menu includes pub fare -- burgers , $T$ and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as `` vegetarians .\n- I got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago , I was in your $T$ .\n- What an amazing $T$ and experience !\n- The food was below average , the service was pathetic , there was no $T$ at all .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- night without a reservation , we had to wait at the bar for a little while , but the $T$ was so nice and made our wait a great experience .\n- One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my $T$ ot incoming guests .\n- The $T$ is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .\n- The staff was too busy ordering $T$ for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check .\n- Could be pricey without a $T$ .\n- The waiters and $T$ were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but were n't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected .\n- The $T$ is always great , and the owner walks around to make sure you enjoy .\n- Favourites include : potato spinach gnocchi and the $T$ .\n- However , the $T$ is absolutely horrible .\n- Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the $T$ .\n- being a fan of $T$ , indian included , i made friends with this place long ago .\n- Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in $T$ for $ 3.00 in NYC .\n- And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and $T$ !\n- I got an excellent piece of $T$ and we had several other nice pastries .\n- An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion -LRB- and kitchen 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the $T$ and soups .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family $T$ .\n- The $T$ is excellent .\n- It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled $T$ over it -LRB- the sauce was translucent and red -RRB- .\n- I noted it was crossed off on the $T$ .\n- What came to our $T$ was burned beyond recognition and stringy .\n- Here 's to the fake $T$ too ...\n- Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you 're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz ' Deli , or $T$ which is supplied by capable restaurants .\n- Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great $T$ .\n- The $T$ here is only so-so .\n- The $T$ was huge .\n- Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your $T$ .\n- I had the $T$ and i ca n't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful .\n- The $T$ is amazing !\n- 20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few $T$ and enjoy our surroundings and each other .\n- The food is great -LRB- big selection , reasonable prices -RRB- and the $T$ are really good .\n- Great wine selection , $T$ is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .\n- The $T$ is an asbolute steal .\n- Not only was the sushi fresh , they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy -LRB- try the $T$ !\n- I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic $T$ .\n- The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one $T$ and entree per person -RRB- for two people .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest service and often free $T$ .\n- The $T$ had an average portion , and was decent overall .\n- The rice was poor quality and was $T$ so badly it was hard .\n- The large selection of bruschettas , paninis , $T$ keep the palate from stagnating .\n- $T$ Waldy 's always measures up .\n- Oh yes , and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars , there are plenty of $T$ of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls , some of which , I would love to know where they obtained .\n- They did n't give us the $T$ until we asked for it .\n- Try the $T$ and the rose special roll .\n- I would have gotten some cole slaw and a $T$ if my stomach had more space .\n- We had the $T$ and it was FANTASTIC .\n- Add to that great service and great $T$ at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .\n- The bartenders and the $T$ are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back , all the while being trendy .\n- After I paid for my purchase , I noticed they had not given me $T$ so I could eat my pie .\n- We could not catch our $T$ 's eye , and he ignored us .\n- The $T$ we experienced was friendly and good .\n- This is the perfect $T$ for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour $T$ from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .\n- Authentic $T$ .\n- Not impressed with the $T$ .\n- Delicate $T$ , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .\n- The food was just OK , at least for what $T$ was available .\n- If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly $T$ and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .\n- While the room is not particularly comfortable , once you 're seated you 'll forget about everything except what 's on your $T$ .\n- Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with $T$ bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !\n- My daughter and I left feeling satisfied -LRB- not stuffed -RRB- and it felt good to know we had a healthy $T$ .\n- I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious $T$ lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .\n- No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our $T$ .\n- Diner $T$ at bistro prices is a bummer ...\n- And forget what you read under me , the $T$ is n't that bad either .\n- The $T$ are also reasonably priced for NYC .\n- The $T$ is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .\n- The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of $T$ .\n- Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of $T$ , gratis .\n- The $T$ should not be overlooked !\n- I have $T$ about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .\n- Horrible $T$ and Horrible service .\n- my picks are : - Scallion Pancake -LRB- fried with vegetable juice , very special and tasty -RRB- - Guizhou Chicken - Shredded Squid Family Style -LRB- one of my personal favorites -RRB- - $T$ - Shuizhu Fish -LRB- this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans , I would n't recommend to my American friends as it 's very spicy .\n- The $T$ is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .\n- My friends and I experienced amazing $T$ and a delicious , new summer menu at Artisanal last night .\n- Also a little more expensive than your average $T$ place .\n- The staff was very attentive , the $T$ lovely , and the food superb .\n- Threw my fiance 's surprise 30th birthday $T$ here could n't be happier .\n- The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the $T$ was forgettable .\n- Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh $T$ .\n- still stay away , the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were $T$ eventhough they were there much longer ...\n- For all of you new to $T$ , try the Paneer Roll , it is a piece of heaven .\n- The $T$ in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud .\n- My friend 's $T$ was also the complete opposite of what it 's supposed to taste like -LRB- aND look like -RRB- .\n- They have some great $T$ here as well .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- in an effort to increase turnover , the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary $T$ .\n- The one vegetarian entree -LRB- Abby 's treasure -RRB- was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had $T$ covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables .\n- We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent $T$ , which was generous , I feel .\n- The $T$ was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .\n- If you are here as a $T$ , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .\n- Try the $T$ -- ginger lemonade with vodka -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive , the $T$ has been overhauled .\n- Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a $T$ .\n- To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert , especially the $T$ .\n- It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the $T$ is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\n- $ 20 for all you can eat $T$ can not be beaten .\n- The $T$ and servers are personable and caring .\n- I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud $T$ till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a $T$ , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , cheese baclava ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Great $T$ , lots of people .\n- We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful $T$ experience !!!\n- We were planning to get dessert but the $T$ basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .\n- Our waiter was fine , the $T$ looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way , but at those prices , a little more should be expected of your food .\n- But the $T$ was good .\n- The $T$ is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .\n- Tasty steak , $T$ , the works .\n- I had the cod with paella -LRB- spicy and very filling , I 'm a big eater and could only eat half -RRB- while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips -LRB- again , a big $T$ - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries -RRB- .\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- From the incredible food , to the warm $T$ , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .\n- They bring a $T$ up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak -LRB- I tried them ALL -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down , it was a pleasurable experience .\n- Growing up in NY , I have eaten my share of $T$ .\n- Casablanca servces delicious falafel , $T$ , humus and other Mediterranean delights , which are all very inexpensive .\n- The $T$ arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .\n- The $T$ is terrible and overall , I would have to say avoid at all costs .\n- The dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , $T$ to the amazing pistachio ice cream -LRB- the best and freshest I 've ever had -RRB- .\n- $T$ and Hostess was quite rude .\n- The dishes are remarkably tasty and such a cozy and intimate $T$ !\n- Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass $T$ .\n- Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite $T$ .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , $T$ was great and the food was excellent !\n- I love the simplicity and respect which was given to the food , as well the $T$ was freindly and knowledgable .\n- Great $T$ at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !\n- If you 're craving some serious indian food and desire a cozy $T$ , this is quite and exquisite choice .\n- If you like the $T$ and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .\n- What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the $T$ is really good .\n- The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and $T$ was poor .\n- at taj , vegetarians can rejoice-all the $T$ are manna from heaven .\n- Simple $T$ and what hot and lage portions .\n- The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested $T$ for my husband he enjoyed his meal .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant $T$ there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .\n- Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a $T$ at the bar .\n- Whether your choose the $T$ or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy .\n- Not only is the food authentic , but the $T$ here are practically off-the-boat , they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine .\n- My goodness , everything from the $T$ to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing .\n- The $T$ came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .\n- Be sure to accompany your food with one of their $T$ .\n- I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful $T$ .\n- We had a party in their $T$ and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .\n- Joya used to be a cool spot with decent $T$ and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere .\n- When the $T$ arrived it was blazing with green chillis , definitely not edible by a human .\n- I ordered $T$ and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .\n- Plus they made a perfect $T$ .\n- The waiters were not attentive except that the $T$ turned up on the table before we were finished .\n- I would like to return and try some of the other $T$ when I do n't have to rush off to a show .\n- The $T$ is great and the prices are reasonable .\n- The $T$ is top notch , the service is attentive , and the atmosphere is great .\n- Made my $T$ uncomfortable .\n- It also has lots of other $T$ that are affordable and just as yummy .\n- Apparently , the good $T$ works then .\n- Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one $T$ .\n- The $T$ is always bad though , do n't expect much of anything from your server , and I would not recommend bringing a date here either .\n- Try the Times Square cocktail -- $T$ -LRB- also available without vodka . -RRB-\n- Try the lobster teriyaki and the $T$ .\n- $T$ delicious !\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the $T$ was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- The $T$ is much better than Sripraphai -LRB- more modern and sleek -RRB- .\n- Best $T$ in NY !\n- good music , great food , speedy $T$ affordable prices .\n- Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked $T$ .\n- The $T$ is perfect .\n- Food was OK - $T$ was cooked well .\n- I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice $T$ in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .\n- The $T$ were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished .\n- This particular location certainly uses substandard $T$ .\n- Why do people rave about the $T$ .\n- This $T$ is incredibly tiny .\n- For some reason , all the $T$ on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .\n- The $T$ here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .\n- Good crowd , good $T$ , with a hip japanese vibe .\n- If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their $T$ .\n- I would highly recommend Nina 's to anyone who wants to have a romantic $T$ in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures .\n- Creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable $T$ .\n- -LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on $T$ .\n- Both a number of the $T$ and pasta specials were amazing .\n- Great Indian food and the $T$ is incredible .\n- This is a consistently great place to $T$ for lunch or dinner .\n- I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the $T$ of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan .\n- Meat dishes now adorn the selections , although there 's still a large number of $T$ .\n- I think the $T$ is good .\n- Sauce was watery and the food did n't have much $T$ .\n- The $T$ was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .\n- My husband had the mesclun , $T$ , and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses .\n- The only friendly staff member was the $T$ at the bar .\n- If it 's just a quick martini at the $T$ -LRB- which I recommend Jeffery 's -RRB- or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !\n- We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the $T$ disappointed .\n- Delicious $T$ at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door .\n- However , being foodies , we were utterly disappointed with the $T$ .\n- First the wrong bread came out with the $T$ , then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course ...\n- The ingredients taste fresher , the $T$ is thinner and crispier , the slice is less oily , and it 's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe 's .\n- Super friendly and knowledgable $T$ , fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz -LRB- the chilaquiles were awesome !\n- You must try Odessa stew or Rabbit stew ; $T$ -
