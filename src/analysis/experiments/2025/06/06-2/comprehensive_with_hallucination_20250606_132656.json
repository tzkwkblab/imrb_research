I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n\n回答：",

I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash.

Well, okay then.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great.

It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n\n回答：",

I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- No stars.

It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards.

On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n\n回答：",

That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n\n回答：",

Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any.

Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out.

It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n\n回答：",

You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system.

Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n\n回答例：Includes technical details or specifications\n\nでは、これから問題を提示します。以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year.

It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any.

I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook.

Well, okay then.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n\n回答：",

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\nでは、これから問題を提示します。以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n\n回答：",

I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected.

You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n\n回答：",

Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook.

They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems.

Highly recommended!\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to.

I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way.

I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy.

Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook.

      "prompt": "あなたはレビューテキスト分析の専門家です。これから 2 つのレビューグループを提示します：\n\n- グループ A：特定の特徴を含むレビュー集合\n- グループ B：その特徴を含まないレビュー集合\n\n【出力形式】\n\n英単語で 5 から 10 単語程度で出してください。\n\n例題1\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use.

Well, okay then.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n\n回答例：Includes technical details or specifications\n\nでは、これから問題を提示します。以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n\n回答：",

You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms.

Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price.

You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\n例題3\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- Really though?

Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\nでは、これから問題を提示します。以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year.

It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though?

I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance.

No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price.

Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these.

They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- Works very well.

You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling.

High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\n例題2\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out.

Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great.

Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- Really though?

I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use.

Highly recommended!\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use.

The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators.

This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses.

Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n\n回答：",

I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\n例題2\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit.

You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\n例題3\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents.

Highly recommended!\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n\n回答例：Mentions long-term usage experience\n\nでは、これから問題を提示します。以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- No stars.

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n\n回答：",

Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook.

You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems.

Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\n例題3\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- No stars.

It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So!

It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n\n回答：",

High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system.

When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n\n回答例：Unknown feature\n\n例題3\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm.

I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible.

On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.)

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook.

A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n\n回答：",

        "I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.",
        "My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.",

        "The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).",

The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.",
        "I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.",
        "Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.",
        "Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.",
        "Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.",
        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",
        "The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!",
        "I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then."

I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it.

Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell.

We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n\nグループB:\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms.

        "These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.",

        "So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!"

        "I enjoyed the original Nook.

I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down.

Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope.

      "prompt": "あなたはレビューテキスト分析の専門家です。これから 2 つのレビューグループを提示します：\n\n- グループ A：ランダムに選択されたレビュー集合\n- グループ B：ランダムに選択されたレビュー集合\n\n【出力形式】\n\n英単語で 5 から 10 単語程度で出してください。\n\n以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness.

What?\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n\n【ステートメント】\nグループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンは以下の通りです：\n\n- \"third party support\"\n- \"personalize your Palm\"\n- \"great little machine\"\n- \"ideal price/feature point\"\n- \"easy to learn and use\"\n- \"concerns you should be aware of\"\n- \"web-enhanced synching utilities\"\n- \"built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook\"\n\nこれらの表現は、製品の機能や利点に関する具体的な情報を提供しており、ユーザーの経験や使用例を詳しく述べています。一方で、グループ B のレビューは主に否定的な体験や不満を中心にしており、製品の特徴や利点について詳しく言及していません。\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers.

        "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",

        "I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.",

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n\n回答：",

Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n\nグループB:\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing.

        "The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!",

        "I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound.

        "So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",

        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",
        "Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.",

        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",

Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy.

But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n\nグループB:\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n\n【ステートメント】\nUnique features in Group A not found in Group B: detailed performance analysis, personal anecdotes, and specific product comparisons.\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

        "Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.",

        "My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones.

        "I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.",

        "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",
        "My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.",
        "These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily.

The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.",
        "I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil.

        "I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash."

Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that.

It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n\nグループB:\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\n【ステートメント】\n- Negative expressions and strong dissatisfaction\n- Personal anecdotes and experiences with the product\n- Specific critiques of functionality and design\n- Usage context and practical advice for prospective buyers\n- Recommendations against purchase based on quality concerns\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

        "I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.",
        "My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.",
        "I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now.

This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.",
        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",
        "I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.",

        "After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.",

        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",
        "The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).",
        "The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine.

        "JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.",

        "These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.",
        "Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.",

Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.",

You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n\n回答：",

We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly.

Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n\n【ステートメント】\nグループ A に特有の特徴や表現パターン：\n\n1. 詳細な使用体験の共有\n2. 製品の性能に関する具体的な数値や比較\n3. 感情的な反応や個人的なストーリーの挿入\n4. 製品の利点と欠点のバランスの取れた評価\n5. 具体的な状況下でのパフォーマンスの言及\n\nこれらの特徴は、グループ B のレビューには見られず、より個人的で具体的な体験に基づいた表現が強調されています。\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

        "I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service.

        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices.

This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash."

I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.",
        "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",

My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n\n回答：",

They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\nグループB:\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall.

        "This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.",

        "So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",
        "I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service.

        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",

        "The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!",

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance.

That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n\nグループB:\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected.

        "These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.",

I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.",
        "I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.",
        "I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.",
        "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",
        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",
        "My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.",
        "Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...",
        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",

      "prompt": "あなたはレビューテキスト分析の専門家です。これから 2 つのレビューグループを提示します：\n\n- グループ A：ランダムに選択されたレビュー集合\n- グループ B：ランダムに選択されたレビュー集合\n\n【出力形式】\n\n英単語で 5 から 10 単語程度で出してください。\n\n以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L.

I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n\nグループB:\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem.

They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.",

The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.",

        "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)"

It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day.

Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n\nグループB:\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n\n【ステートメント】\nグループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンは以下の通りです：\n\n- 手間を省くための具体的な機能やプログラムの言及\n- 商品に対する長期的な使用感や比較詳細\n- ユーザーの期待やニーズに基づく具体的な提案\n- 体験談を交えた個人的な感情や視点の強調\n- 他社製品との比較や批判的な言及\n\nこれらの特徴は、グループ A のレビューに特有であり、グループ B では見られません。\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

        "These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.",

        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",

        "The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).",

        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",

        "So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",
        "This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling.

        "I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash."

We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since.

Other than that they are perfect.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\n回答：",

I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job.

He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n\n【ステートメント】\n- Customer service issues and complaints.\n- Detailed product usage experience and recommendations.\n- Specific suggestions for product improvements.\n- Personal anecdotes related to product use.\n- Negative comparisons with competitor products.\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",

        "No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",
        "Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",

Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n\n回答：",

You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n\nグループB:\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness.

        "This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.",

        "I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.",

        "The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!",

If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",
        "I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.",
        "JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.",
        "These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.",
        "Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results."

      "prompt": "あなたはレビューテキスト分析の専門家です。これから 2 つのレビューグループを提示します：\n\n- グループ A：ランダムに選択されたレビュー集合\n- グループ B：ランダムに選択されたレビュー集合\n\n【出力形式】\n\n英単語で 5 から 10 単語程度で出してください。\n\n以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud.

Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price.

The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n- I bought these headphones for my kids' portable DVD players; they were smaller in nature and inexpensive, so I thought them to be a perfect fit. The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product. To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n\n【ステートメント】\nGroup A に存在し、Group B に存在しない特徴や表現パターン：\n\n- 「almost two years now」\n- 「exceeded expectations」\n- 「I wish the aperture was a little bigger」\n- 「with enough -ins and -outs」\n- 「easy access and quick find」\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",

Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true.

        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",

        "I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.",
        "My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.",
        "I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.",
        "So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",

This one did the trick.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n- I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year. I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- My husband and I were recently on a trip along the Oregon coast and to view the Giant Redwoods of California. We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)\n\n回答：",

To bury the fact that this item is \"reconditioned\" at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it.\n- Pros: Bass is amazing, mid range sounds like your right there in theGreat pair of phones for the price I believe.performance. High range sounds incredible. Feels light and comfortable. Keeps you connected with surroundings. Comes with a pretty gold extension plug haha I can play my music full blast and the music just sounds even more clear, and no pressure from the loudness. Just more juicy.Cons: A little weird on the ears when the head band it pulled to fit around the back of the head. A little pressure on the top of my ears with head band pulled up over the top of head. No instructions on which way to wear the phones.\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n\nグループB:\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones. The bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable MP3 players. Toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these. My only regret was not buying this pair earlier.\n- I needed more memory in order to add additional coverage for my Garmin Nuvi GPS. This one did the trick.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy!

Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life.

I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service.

        "As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?",
        "The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!",
        "I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.",

The fit is good for my six year old, but not so much for my three year old. They were inexpensive, so I didn't expect much out of them, but they have pretty good sound. I only wish they had cupped ear covers, so that they would stay on better in the back seat; but for this price, you really can't complain.\n- These are great classic \"cans\". I've had them for a month and started using them after a few days burn-in when these V6s were plugged in 24/7 to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level. And this is what I would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound - play them non-stop for about 100 hours without listening and then you will start to hear their best.They fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely. Bass goes low down to 5Hz but it's not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way. From a good recording all you hear is a clean low punch.The only one thing I would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds. I might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donuts.If you get them for around sixty shipped, then it's a good deal.\n- Not as good as the built in mic of my Nexus 4, which I was looking to improve. There's some static on all recordings, and I'm not sure what to do about it. It was cheap, so I'm not too broken hearted about it...\n- I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security, well designed and thought out. Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- After always buying cheap cables or inheriting half working cables I bought a few of these. They work great and have nice clip protectors. Handy to have a few extras of these around.\n- Works very well. Used on 2 different CD players that were starting to skip, and took care of the problem. Easy to follow audio directions.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before.

Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n- Look at the price folks. That says it all! Unless you need this lens for a special reason then don't bother. If you know how to use this lens then go for it. But, as I stated before, look at the price. There is a good reason why it's cost is a lot lower than the IS lenses. If you are going the distance and paying for a state of the art camera then don't ask it to use old types of lenses and expect spectacular results.\n- After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the \"protective\" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.\n- These ties are just what I expected from the photo and description. They are 8\" velcro ties with a little tag on the end so you can grasp them easily. The colors are identical to the product photo, and the quality is high.I use these for managing all the wires and cords in my workspace and they do a great job. The only improvement I might suggest is make the tag white so I can write notes on it with a sharpie, like PR for Printer or ST for Stereo. Other than that they are perfect.\n- especially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unit\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I bought this lens not quite realizing it didn't have Image Stabilization (my bad). It's an excellent lens, I like the optics (though I do wish the aperture was a little bigger) though the lack of image stabilization means you likely have to use a tripod for taking quality pictures.\n- I'm hard on headphones. I use them at work all day long and they get a work out. I've gone through 6 sets less than a year and a half. When these arrived, I groaned. They appeared much flimsier than I expected. Well, more than six months later, these phones are going strong. Sound is good, quality is good. There ya go! These have been around forever. I think I'm figuring out why.\n\n【ステートメント】\n\"Price-sensitive, specific product expectations, troubleshooting issues.\"\n\n【評価】\nこのステートメントのハルシネーションスコア（0～1）を数値のみで回答してください：",
