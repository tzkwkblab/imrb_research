I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it. This is so even after I have purchased \"better lenses.\" I did take some test shots to post. See the bougainvilla, cat, and \"Wild Thing\" test images above. Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled \"bad lenses.\" In general, I have not found the lens to be \"bad\" but instead to be a \"good lens when used appropriately.\" It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens. But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:\"It is a poor workman that blames his tools.\"I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens. I read this \"johnhopkins\" posting about this lens on the \"fredmiranda-com photo site.\" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to \"fredmiranda-com.\" The poster \"johnhopkins\" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L. He found that:\"The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.\"My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:\"If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible.\" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.\n- As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices. There are handhelds with bigger screens used to read ebooks(records memos too!). I don't recommand people buying a color handheld if they can't change the battery or even use back up batteries.What?'Cuz Simon Said So! What?\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please. Worth like 3 bucks.And they feel like their gonna break everytime i touch them.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio. Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that. On a positive note, it was very simple to install.\n- No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n\n回答例：Contains mentions of price or cost\n\nでは、これから問題を提示します。以下の二つのグループのレビューを見て、グループ A に存在し、グループ B に存在しない特徴や表現パターンを特定し、その違いを回答してください。\n\n【グループ A のレビュー】\n- I purchased this VCR as a gift for my parents. They've been using it for playback and recording for almost two years now. It has had no problems and has functioned as expected.The controls, remote, and hookups were easy to figure out, with enough -ins and -outs for the basic AV system. This VCR functions much quiter than the one it replaced.\n- The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems. I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm. The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo. Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available. For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system. Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software. I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point. With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine. It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other. By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer. I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do. You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings. First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc. If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice. (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.) Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us. Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries. This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power. One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function. He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision. Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use. Highly recommended!\n- I used to have a lot of respect for TEAC products, but some years back they took the cheaply-made consumer electronics route and it's been downhill ever since. That said, this is a decent machine, and I enjoyed it during its short life. Shortly after my warranty expired (of course), I accidentally bumped the CD tray when it was open one day, knocking the gears and everything out of whack, and it was all over....never could get the tray to go back in right or the CD door to stay closed. The unit is now with a pile waiting to go to the dump and was essentially a couple hundred bucks flushed down the toilet. Handle with care!!\n- So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!\n- This radio is easy to use, and sounds great. Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good. You also get sideband tuning, which you'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators. Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to. With the supplied aux. antenna, reception is noticably improved. It comes with ear-bud headphones, AC adapter and the aux antenna. It also has AM and FM reception. FM is stereo with the headphones, and is very good quality. It has 2 built in clocks (believe me, you WANT that!!) 40 memories, and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling. This could be considered an entry level radio, but it is sensetive enough that you won't \"out grow\" it for a very long time.\n\n【グループ B のレビュー】\n- I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.

We bought this lens to go along with our Canon Rebel TSi 12 megapixel camera. Some have said they could not take action shots with it but I have great photos of sea gulls in flight and the waves as they crest, curl, and crash on the beach. You can see the feathers on the birds. I also took photos of the ocean crashing against rocks and they are so clear you can see the outer water droplets. We also bought a High-speed SD memory disk which could have helped with the photos. I would recommend this lens.\n- The Nook Color is a mixed bag of a product with some highs and lows.The hardware on the Nook Color is very nice.The screen, though not a super hi-def retina like high end tabs, is bright and great for books, video, comics, etc. It feels solid and sturdy but not overly heavy. A nice addition is the SD Card slot hidden in the back which can be used to expand storage or, if you're resourceful (or purchase a Nook 2 Android card) convert your Nook into a full-fledged Android tablet on the cheap.The Interface in the Nook Color is adequate but not amazing.Barnes and Noble created their own \"flavor\" of Android for this reader. While it's not highly customization or super elegant it's well suited for the intended purposes of this tablet: media consumption. As noted above, this reader can run full Android quite well if modded, and still run a Nook App.Lackluster AppsApp support for this reader is very spartan. You'll find some simple games, Netflix (finally) and a few others, but it's not a lot to write home about.If you want a simple reader with a nice screen for ereading, this isn't a bad buy if you can get one at a good price (I wouldn't pay more than 110 at the moment). Otherwise, it's a great Android tablet if you mod it yourself or take the safer route of using a Nook 2 Android card).\n- Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before.

Delivered on schedule, with usual good service.\n\n回答：",
