      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it",
      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",
      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",
      "RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.",
      "Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.",
      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",
      "I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10",
      "[h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.",
      "Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.",
      "I pay money for early access\nA lot of bug but developer dont care you feedback just update useless money sea and let player survivel in game without water\n\nNow developer just want reset you save that i play 33hr to build\n\nHowever, New story so fucking soggy \nI have play this game before update can see some timeline \n\nNew update dont care everything you can get in late chapter of the game without vehicle. Just run in and die \n\nStory so confuse if you new plyer and play in this update you will get bad and confuse experience\n\n\nI disappointed to this dev \n\nBut interest in concept of this game\n\nI suggest you to buy when it already full game\n\nDont waste your time in early access with dev who’s not care supporter",
      "As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10",
      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",

      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last.

      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing.

      "Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value.

With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",
      "Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.",
      "The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n"

      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",

      "For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.",

      "Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning.

      "After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n",
      "While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.",

      "Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n",

      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",

      "Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.",
      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.",

AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.)

Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- [h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.\n- Bioshock Infinite is the third and (presumably) final game in the venerable Bioshock series of narrative driven FPS action games.  Gameplay, as always, consists of somewhat linear FPS combat with a \"genetic\" progression advancement system that lets you upgrade your abilities through \"splicing\" \"plasmids\".  This gives you somewhat supernatural abilities to augment the more traditional shooting of enemies with guns that we all enjoy from FPS games.  There's also the usual gamut of minigames, with a carnival theme to them. \n\nFrom the technical perspective, even though this is getting a little old, it's a AAA game and it shows.  Everything gamers expect is delivered here in terms of visual tweaks, control customisation, 4K support and a lot of graphics fine tuning options to allow gamers to experience a perfectly optimised experience.  There's not much else to say when developers get it right!  The visuals are equally top notch. \n\nWhile a great technical implementation is a must, and a minimum requirement for a recommendable game, of course Bioshock Infinite goes beyond that to deliver a masterpiece story that will leave gamers hooked, and perhaps a little bereft once it's over, but that's how all great stories should be.\n\nBioshock Infinite is a must-play for fans of narrative FPS games, although I do recommend trying Bioshock 1 & 2 first.  It's not required, but just like you wouldn't enjoy it as much if you watched Return of the Jedi first, you should try the first two episodes of Bioshock before the third one.\n- I pay money for early access\nA lot of bug but developer dont care you feedback just update useless money sea and let player survivel in game without water\n\nNow developer just want reset you save that i play 33hr to build\n\nHowever, New story so fucking soggy \nI have play this game before update can see some timeline \n\nNew update dont care everything you can get in late chapter of the game without vehicle. Just run in and die \n\nStory so confuse if you new plyer and play in this update you will get bad and confuse experience\n\n\nI disappointed to this dev \n\nBut interest in concept of this game\n\nI suggest you to buy when it already full game\n\nDont waste your time in early access with dev who’s not care supporter\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.\n- *selects waifu*\n*waifu dies*\n*selects next waifu*\n*next waifu dies*\n*select husbando*\n*husbando dies*\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.\n\nFor a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:\nhttp://www.protagonistcomplex.com/tomb-raider-2013-review/\nIt talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.\nIf you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop?

We just didn’t market it again.\n- [h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n\n\n【グループB】\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.\n- Instead of spending 30€+ on a game you'll never play, buy this. For 2€ you'll get more than your money's worth.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- After playing the game for almost 10 hours which i know is not a lot but still i had a great time the story kept me hooked from start to finish and i was always excited to find out what was going to happen next. I loved the idea that you could choose to play as a ghost and never get detected or never kill anyone or just go for the high chaos im going to kill everyone playstyle and even know the ability to choose your playstyle is quite oftenly seen these days but back in 2012 it was quite inovative.\n\nGameplay:\nIt had great combat and stealth.(Not Suprising based on thre fact that your an assasin)\nStory was well how to put this \"A rollercoaster of emotion\" it keeps you hooked from start to finish and you will never want to stop playing until you finaly get to the end.\n\nReplay Value:\nNow this is a big one in my opinion because i like games that make you play for hours and hours and I would say that Dishonored has great replay value this is mainly due to the fact that there are a lot of different acheivements, ways to complete each mission, different magic paths and weapon paths that can only be be completed if you play the game again and if your not comftable with fully restarting you dont have to because once you finish the main storyline you unlock the option to play them over which is useful if you want to unlock some of the other acheivements for example Clean Hands to get this acheivement your not allowed to kill anyone in the whole story how you do this i have no idea but thats the reason this game has good replay value.\n\nDLC:\nEven though i do not own the DLC (i will be purchasing them soon) from my knowledge of the normal game and how great that was it would suprise me if the DLC was bad.\n\nIn conclusion i would highly reccomend this game to anyone who doenst already own it!\n\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- Driving feels unrealistic, am I driving a car, or a boat?\nStealth system simply sucks, can't hide bodies, each guard in the restricted area knows exaclty where are you hiding after one of them spots you.\nMade a refund request.\n\nAlthought graphic is nice, and story seems fun.\nI'd recommend to pick this on sale, and not for a full price.\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- If Level Editor is published in Just Shapes & Beats, This Game would be \"The Popular Music Game\"\nWe all like LEVEL EDITOR right?\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- COCOON is a breathtaking, unique puzzle game. Great visuals and music combined with mind-bending puzzles make for an unforgettable experience.\n\nAlso, the Pizza Tower community can get bent\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- Upon further play, the game wasn't super luck based, it just doesn't do a great job explaining core mechanics that are crucial to gameplay. It has a more hands off, let the player discover how this works type of playstyle, but a simple line of dialogue alluding to these features would have been nice. That said, the story is really gripping, the gameplay (once learned) is fun, and overall, I definitely think it's worth $20.\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- ~ DIFFICULTY ~\n\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n🔲 Easy\n🔲 Normal\n✅ Hard\n🔲 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n🔲 MS Paint\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Meh\n🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game\n✅ Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n🔲 Masterpiece\n\n~ MUSIC ~\n\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Not special\n🔲 Good\n✅ Beautiful\n\nI WILL GIVE YOU MY ALL! and also FLAMES OF LOVE is a hit\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n🔲 This game has no story\n🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n✅ It's there for the people who want it\n🔲 Well written\n🔲 Epic story\n🔲 Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n🔲 Free\n🔲 Underpriced\n✅ Perfect Price\n🔲 Could be cheaper\n🔲 Overpriced\n🔲 Complete waste of money\n\nIt went free on some point\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\n✅ Average\n🔲 High end\n🔲 NASA computer\n\n~ LENGTH ~\n\n🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)\n🔲Short (2 - 15 hours)\n🔲 Average (15-50 hours)\n🔲 Long (50-90 hours)\n🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)\n✅ No ending\n\n~ FUN ~\n\n🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\n🔲 Repetitive\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\n🔲The kind of fun you'll remember\n✅ Ride of your life\n\n~ REPLAYABILITY~\n\n🔲 It's a one-time experience\n🔲 Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months/years\n✅ Definitely\n🔲 Infinitely replayable\n\n~ WORTH BUYING ~\n\n🔲 No\n✅ Wait for sale\n✅ Yes\n- Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- Instead of spending 30€+ on a game you'll never play, buy this. For 2€ you'll get more than your money's worth.\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- Too litle content for it's price. 2 scenes only and 0 choices.\n- What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise! Fun to wear if you are feeling oldschool)\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
