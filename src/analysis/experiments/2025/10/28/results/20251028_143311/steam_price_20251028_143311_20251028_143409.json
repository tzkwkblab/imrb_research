      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",
      "It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.",
      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.",
      "I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.",
      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
      "Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",

      "Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.",
      "Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!",
      "It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.",
      "Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.",

      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode.

      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",

      "I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10",
      "Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox.

Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it.

      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",

      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.",
      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",

      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level.

      "I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.",

      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",

Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",

Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.",
      "As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...",
      "For those of you with controllers:\n\nPress B to quack. \n\nPress Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be. \n\nThe more you know.\n\n\n\nDuck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar). \n\nIf you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.",
      "Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.",

      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",
      "I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n",
      "Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10",
      "Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats."

The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- You had me at creating adventure log, well actually no, at the starting song perhaps. How many years have I been waiting for full fledge, non portable DQ since DQVIII in PS2 ?\n\nThis PC port is a great one, neat and very beautiful. I was playing at 4k/~30fps and since my GPU is not fast enough I switched to 1440p/~50-60fps instead. I wish more and more JRPGs to do PC concurrent launch like this one. A day later I switched back to 4k and change internal resolution to 80% then it was pretty much perfect.\n\n- You can choose default A/B button.\n- You can choose resolution and 30/60 FPS mode. There is a way to unlock 60+ FPS for gaming monitors, google it.\n- You can invert cameras both ways.\n- You can choose classic battle mode.\n- You can press L3 and enjoy the view.\n- Load time is non-existence with SSD.\n- Ultra Widescreen is NOT supported. Waiting for mods at the moment.\n- Keyboard and Mouse is fine but playing with controller is wayy better.\n- Fully customisable keys / controllers.\n- Story synopsys at game loading screen.\n- Silent Protagonist.\n- Full voice cutscenes.\n- Auto-run button.\n- You can jump.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- While I don't necessarily play medieval type games...I thought I should give this game a go...but tbh I was highly disappointed...this game is poorly optimized...full of glitches...poor characterization... terrible voice acting....& terrible facial expressions...only good thing about this game is the detailing of the rats...and some lighting effects...other than that this is just another pathetic excuse of a game.... wouldn't recommend it even on sale...it's a huge let down...tbh...\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- Devs are on meth pricing this game at $44\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- Take Dota2, HoN or LoL. Strip away all the farming, item buying, running around and randomness. \nThat leaves you with pure fast paced battles in an arena. \nNo random effects, just skill based combat with WASD controls and mouse aiming.\nThat's Battlerite.\n\n【グループB】\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- [b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- For those of you with controllers:\n\nPress B to quack. \n\nPress Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be. \n\nThe more you know.\n\n\n\nDuck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar). \n\nIf you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
