      "For those of you with controllers:\n\nPress B to quack. \n\nPress Left Trigger to change the pitch of your quack; the more pressure you put on Left Trigger, the higher pitched your quack will be. \n\nThe more you know.\n\n\n\nDuck Game is an awesome game where a group of up to 4 ducks are pitted amongst eachother with a plethora of unique weapons. Matches are fast paced, with the only goal being \"stay alive longer than your friends\". It almost reminds me of a competetive version of Super Crate Box (the gunplay feels similar). \n\nIf you're looking for a goofy game to play with some of your friends, whether locally or online, pick this game up.",
      "VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.",

      "Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy",
      "THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p",
      "A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.",
      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.",
      "WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10",

      "It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.",
      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",

Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist.

      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one.

      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack.

      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",
      "[h1]Gameplay : 9/10\nGraphic : 9/10\nCommunity : -25/10 ( updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me.   \nI wrote\" negative 25.\")\n\n\nPlaying with friends: 11/10\nCompetitiveness&balance: 11/10\n[/h1]\n----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------\n\n         For those of you who aren't familiar with the MOBA genre, here's a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.\nIn addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.\n\n         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.\n\n\n[h1]Overall:\npros: A much better game than lol\ncons: A much harder game than lol\n\nLMAO\nquit playing trash game plz[/h1]\n\n----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------\nPROS\n\n1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start.

      "tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.",

      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great."

      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",

      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",

      "I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.",
      "Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!",
      "This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.",
      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.",

      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",

      "I'm glad to say Mr. Grapefrukt and his collaborators have done it again, combining pool, golf, and roguelite-esque gameplay with charming visuals and music to create an absurdly fun little time sink, much like Holedown, which I've played and replayed to completion on every platform it exists on.\n\nI tried to stay unspoiled on the details of the game mechanics before going into it so I could experience everything totally fresh, and I've been delighted by mixing and matching challenge cards and the different ball types that impact how you play.\n\nThe whole thing is charming, and aside from being an obvious extension of Holedown's best design sensibilities, it feels like a fair bit of its ethos took cues from Triband's fresh, novel, and light-hearted takes on sports like golf, baseball, and racing. I really enjoyed What the Golf, and eagerly look forward to the next time Triband makes a game that's on a platform I own, so that inspiration is extremely welcome in Subpar Golf, haha.\n\nIt's hard to put a number on all of the work that goes into a video game over time, but I can say confidently that $10 is more than fair for a really fun game that's been in the works for...

      "[h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]",

It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- > go into time trial\n> classic f1 cars\n> 2004 ferrari\n> put on headphones\n> play with that gorgeous v10 as soundtrack\n> best day ever\n\nalso career mode is great\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.\n- Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.\n\n(New Account info and Instructions)\nNew Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry\n\nHere is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well) \n\n(enter these in the store, top right \"redeem code\" field) \nIM SURE THERE ARE MORE CODES OUT THERE THESE ARE THE ONES I KNOW WORK IN 2023\nFree Booster Pack Codes ( 48 packs from these code alone for a total of 69 with the free mail claims at time of writing)\nPlayBRO\nPlayDMUAlchemy\nPlayDMU\nplayHBG\nPlayAlchemyNewCapenna\nPlaySNC\nPlayNEOAlchemy\nPlayNEO\nPlayVOW\nPlayMID\nPlayDND\nPlayKaldheim\nPlayZendikar\nPLAYM21\nPlayIkoria\nPlayTheros\n\nEXP CODES:\nThreads\t1,000 XP\n\nCOSMETIC CODES:\nFNMATHOME\nInformationIsPower\nCrimeIsAnArtForm\nAlwaysFinishTheJob\nFunIsntFree\nReadTheFinePrint\n:updated:\n\n*REMEMBER TO UPVOTE THIS POST AND SHARE WITH OTHERS, MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER:)*\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- SUMMARY: \nI couldn't put this down for about a week and really felt like I got my moneys worth. Considering I'm ADHD and have over 400 games in my library I feel like thats a rare thing for any game to accomplish these days. It held my attention and I'm writing a review which I never do, so ... give it a SHOT!  \n\nPROS:\n\nSuprisingly fun and fulfilling gameplay.\n\nGood progression curve. \n\nLots of fun weapons.\n\nCharacters with unique abilities.\n\nRandom map generation. \n\nHat collecting. \n\nCharming graphics.\n\nNew game+ mode\n\nCONS:\n\nCould be a bit longer, with more weapons and chapters.\n\nNo oversized anime breasts on the female steambots. \n\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- i thought it is overpriced eventhough its good, but it am wrong, \nall ascpects in the game are well made with high quality.\nspecial thanks to accessibility setting, very thoughtful for players.\nand it runs perfeclty in steam deck\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- Who would win?\n\nThe highest-grossing media franchise of all time OR 2 British bois\n- [b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.\n- [h1]Gameplay : 9/10\nGraphic : 9/10\nCommunity : -25/10 ( updated, people see this wrong and keep asking me.   \nI wrote\" negative 25.\")\n\n\nPlaying with friends: 11/10\nCompetitiveness&balance: 11/10\n[/h1]\n----------------------------------------INTRO--------------------------------------------------\n\n         For those of you who aren't familiar with the MOBA genre, here's a quick explanation. There are two bases, each on opposing corners of the map, and one for each team. The objective is to destroy the opposing team's base. Three roads, or lanes, connect the bases. Low-level units automatically and periodically spawn from each base in groups, and these soldiers travel down the three paths between the bases. As a result, there is always a battle going on in the trio of lanes.\nIn addition, each team has three defensive towers in each lane on their side of the map, totaling nine towers per team. These structures deliver powerful attacks against enemy soldiers and players, but they can be destroyed through significant effort. Because of this, fights tend to center on the towers.\n\n         All of this happens automatically. Unlike in typical RTS games, you don't have to collect resources, build structures, or train units. You only control your hero, which can level up and acquire a range of upgradeable powers. However, its role might best be described as support for the A.I. soldier units. Players help control the battlefronts and destroy enemy towers in the lanes. The idea is to to open your opponent's base up to a direct attack by the A.I. and hero once the towers in a lane are gone. There are five players per team, which of course doesn't divide into the three lanes equally. When a player dies, he respawns at the team's base after a penalty period.\n\n\n[h1]Overall:\npros: A much better game than lol\ncons: A much harder game than lol\n\nLMAO\nquit playing trash game plz[/h1]\n\n----------------------------------------Pro&Con---------------------------------------------\nPROS\n\n1,   All At Your Fingertips – players have access to ALL of the game's heroes from the start. No need to unlock or purchase heroes. ( poor LOL)\n2,  Snowball Easily – dying results in a loss of gold, can magnify the effects of snowballing(Buyback system can make sure you don't lose a game with just one mistake).\n3,  Huge Variety of Cosmetics and Skins – players can customize individual parts of their heroes from both valve and community. (weapons, armor, helmets, etc.).\n4,   Custom Game Support – players can build their own custom games within Dota 2 (Pudge Wars, Tower defenses, Racing, Battleships, and more!)\n5,   Skill-Based and Competitive – similar to LoL, Dota 2 is heavily reliant on a player's skill, is very competitive, and has a large e-Sports scene.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1 , Dota directly affects on your life (social life) \n2 , Time consuming( Avg about 45 min per game + additional queuing time(about 3-10 mins depends on your region))\n3 , Hard for newbies ( up to 500 hrs bot practices at least ---usually about 800 hrs)\n4 , hbp due to rage (you may having 3 r e t a r d s and peru feeder/feeders on your side of team)\n[spoiler]5 , Addiction(the true e-drug)[/spoiler]\n\n---------------------------------------ADDITIONS---------------------------------------------\n\nDon't spend too much money on treasures. All the rare items can be purchased through community market if you feel like you are not gonna get any of rare sets.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n\n【グループB】\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- My favorite part of history was when Ghandi built the Great wall in 4000 BC for his Jewish army.\n10/10, helped me with history class.\n- The best games Telltale has ever made, plus one that is very mediocre\n-Season One: 10/10 - A masterpiece, prepare to be hit right on the feelings and cry a lot\n-Season Two: 9/10 - Awesome, and very very sad. More tears at the end\n-A New Frontier:  7/10 - Kinda good, kinda bad, mixed feelings, not much to make me care for the new characters\n-Michonne: 3/10 - Boring as hell, uninspired history, bad characters, Michone is awesome on the comics and the show, here she´s just annoying\n-The Final Season: 10/10 - OMG this game made me cry from the beggining to the end, it´s soooo good, and the end is soooo satisfying\n- I'm glad to say Mr. Grapefrukt and his collaborators have done it again, combining pool, golf, and roguelite-esque gameplay with charming visuals and music to create an absurdly fun little time sink, much like Holedown, which I've played and replayed to completion on every platform it exists on.\n\nI tried to stay unspoiled on the details of the game mechanics before going into it so I could experience everything totally fresh, and I've been delighted by mixing and matching challenge cards and the different ball types that impact how you play.\n\nThe whole thing is charming, and aside from being an obvious extension of Holedown's best design sensibilities, it feels like a fair bit of its ethos took cues from Triband's fresh, novel, and light-hearted takes on sports like golf, baseball, and racing. I really enjoyed What the Golf, and eagerly look forward to the next time Triband makes a game that's on a platform I own, so that inspiration is extremely welcome in Subpar Golf, haha.\n\nIt's hard to put a number on all of the work that goes into a video game over time, but I can say confidently that $10 is more than fair for a really fun game that's been in the works for... I think half a decade (give or take). I say skip the sale and get it now; reward the devs for doing a great job if you have the means! 😊\n- What should i say, the dream has come true.\nKept us waiting, huh.\n\n---\nOLD REVIEW JUST FOR DOCUMENTATION\n\nif you're new, here's your list of the main games\n\nmetal gear (msx)\nmetal gear 2 (msx)\nmetal gear solid (ps1)\nmetal gear solid 2 sons of liberty (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 3 snake eater (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 4 guns of the patriots (ps3)\nmetal gear rising: revengeance (pc)\nmetal gear solid peace walker hd (ps3)\nmetal gear solid v ground zeroes (pc)\nmetal gear solid v the phantom pain (pc)\n\n*: mgs2 and mgs3 have a ps3/x360 HD ver.\n*: there is also mgs2: substance and mgs3: subsistence which are expanded editions: the former has bonus VR missions, snake tales, skateboarding and extras. and the latter includes extra content + metal gear 1 and 2.\n\nthank you for all the mem(es)ories kojima san!\n- [h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator!

This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
