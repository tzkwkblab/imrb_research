      "WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!",
      "Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it",
      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "[h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on. Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n...

Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data.

F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again.

      "This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",
      "One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina",
      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",

      "Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials.

      "If Level Editor is published in Just Shapes & Beats, This Game would be \"The Popular Music Game\"\nWe all like LEVEL EDITOR right?",
      "Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.",

The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.",
      "Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks.

      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!"

REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n... Now I have to start over in Argentina. It's fine, Argentina is nice, it means I can tell you about the excellent track designs, which I'm fairly sure much like Dirt Rally, have been taken from real world locations and are distilled down versions of their real lif-\n\n\"Unable to connect to racenet. MyTeam is Unavailable.\"\n\n...\n\nYou know what? None of what I say is going to matter. Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- One of the hardest game I've ever played, also the most fun. Satisfying gameplay + pretty cool visuals and story. The moment the game clicks for you is like crack. Finishing the game gave me a better feeling than that one time I escaped child services by immigrating to Argentina\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n\n【グループB】\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- If Level Editor is published in Just Shapes & Beats, This Game would be \"The Popular Music Game\"\nWe all like LEVEL EDITOR right?\n- Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
