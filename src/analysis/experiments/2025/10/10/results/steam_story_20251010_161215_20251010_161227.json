      "Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.",
      "Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10",
      "I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic). Probably 5.5/10 for now and I'll revise when i get the English experience?",
      "Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!",
      "Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.",
      "You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10",
      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",
      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.",
      "Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]",
      "Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.",
      "Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.",
      "[h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]",

      "Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back.

      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",
      "\"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",
      "In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
      "It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not",
      "Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!",
      "It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough",
      "As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.",

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one. \n\nDo yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.\nJust play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

      "Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise.

      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",
      "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",
      "[i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",
      "Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.",
      "Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.\n\nFor a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:\nhttp://www.protagonistcomplex.com/tomb-raider-2013-review/\nIt talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.\nIf you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",

      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish.

      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game.

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",

I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it."

      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",

      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either.

Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.",

      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.

      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues.

AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",

      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever).

It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim.

The 53 hours listed at the time here is almost all actual play time.\n\nIf all it was, was the sheer joy of fast-moving with a web, slinging from one side of the screen to the next, it would be kind of fun and not knowing why you were doing it, but still doing it.  We've sat playing in the intro screen.  However to add the technique of throwing laser-sabres, timing bomb throws, that sweet rush of hitting an opposing spider with a mine --- this game is one of my all-time favorite couch coop game easily rivaling Ascention, Killer Queen Black, Samurai Gunn 2, or Boomerang-Fu.   It is indeed the pool a fly can drink from and an elephant can swim.\n\nMy kids (9 & 11) are absolutely ecstatic over it.  If they didn't know what they were doing initially, they made-do by swinging around and flailing with the weapons, still having a good time.  Eventually they managed to figure out how to force pull a laser saber after throwing it, and managing a kill on the return.   Online, while I'm pretty good at this, I haven't found I need to 'git gud'.   I can do a reasonable job against people who have practiced way more than I have and clearly have the moves to back it up.   This game is dad-compatible. \n\nYou really won't regret getting this game.  With multiplayer couch co-ops it's hard to know who has the goods as a great game and who is just \"well, with the right crowd, hitting each other with sticks is fun.\"   This definitely has the goods.

      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options.

      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "$15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games.

      "Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!",

      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper!

      "Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable.

The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it."

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10\n- I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic). Probably 5.5/10 for now and I'll revise when i get the English experience?\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- Sticking with the usual air of cool and weird and the usual musical flair, the latest Cosmo D entry changes up the FPS gameplay for a dice rolling RPG with quirky characters and little surprises to be found (and making pizza, of course). Can be beaten in a couple of hours but rewards multiple playthroughs for different gameplay paths and endings that can be mixed up with difficulty modifiers and challenges.\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- [h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]\n- [h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game.

The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading! Please leave a comment if you feel I have left anything of importance out or if you just want to share your thoughts. Cheers!\n- Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!\n- I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!\n- It was a nice little trip, about 8 hours of gameplay (A bit more if you feel like grinding)\nStory went along nicely from start to end, in no place felt rushed.All sidequest can be done as you progress on the story.\nCombat is nice, and gotta apply every mechanic you had learnt about to fight the final boss.\nThe music, both in fights and background is really nice, has some nice Cyber-future feel\nRecommended? Yes. \nRating 9/10. Hoping for DLC or sequel soon enough\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one. \n\nDo yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.\nJust play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n\n- Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands. Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro?

Ex Pe-P-Pee? \n\n[code]Niche, obscure and underrated games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- [i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.\n\nFor a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:\nhttp://www.protagonistcomplex.com/tomb-raider-2013-review/\nIt talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.\nIf you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix Curator [/url][/b]\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- The original was and still is one of the best 2D sprite art horror game out there. And this remake does it justice!\n\nIt comes with updated art and some new scenes and sequences, so there is something for returning and new players alike.\n\nHonestly, I just feel happy that I can finally pay for this game. The original one being free was a steal for being so good.\nEven to this day, I still get surprised on the level of detail of the sprites, the genuine sentimentality of the story and boy, did this version made me cry!\n\nA must if you are a fan of RPG maker esque horror games, or Madoka Magica, or deep dives into a person's psyche, or lolita fashion or all of the above :p\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- [h1]A True Classic[/h1] \n[u]scroll down for my general consensus[/u]\n\n[b]===[ Audience ]===  [/b]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n [b]===[ Graphics ]===  [/b]\n☐ Potato\n☐ Terrible\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Drop Dead Gorgeous\n☐ Real life\n\n[b]===[ Price/Quality ]===  [/b]\n☑ Full price \n☐ Wait for sale \n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n[b]===[ Requirements ]===  [/b]\n☑ 00's PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n[b]===[ Difficulty ]=== [/b]\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Too easy\n☐ Easy\n☑ Medium\n☐ Hard\n☐ Dark Souls\n☐ Battletoads\n\n [b]===[ Game time/length ]=== [/b]\n☐ Really short\n☐ Short \n☐ Few hours\n☑Normal Runtime (clocking at 15h)\n☐ Long (about 30[i]ish[/i] hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n[b]===[ Blood/Gore ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☑ Only blood\n☐ Blood and some Graphic Violence but not something extreme\n\n[b]===[ Violence ]=== [/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Mild\n☑ Average\n☐ Violent\n☐ Manhunt\n☐ Mortal Kombat\n\n[b]===[ Soundtrack ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Annoying\n☐ Better than Despacito\n☐ Good\n☑ Cool and very creative\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n[b]===[ Story ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Better than Twilight\n☐ OK (more on that below)\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[b]===[ Bugs ]===  [/b]\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Many bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ No bugs\n\n[b]===[ Others ]=== \nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound Design: 8.5/10 ( I didn't like the sound mixing)\nOverall: 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]A true classic. [/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n\n【グループB】\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- My favorite part of history was when Ghandi built the Great wall in 4000 BC for his Jewish army.\n10/10, helped me with history class.\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- SICK Art Style\nSICK Mechanics\nSICK Game\n- Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- This game got criminally low attention.\nThis is basically Risk Of Rain, but Top Down, less budget and same amount of fun.\nI've played just a bit before writing this, and yes, I can already see some flaws in the game, yet it definitely is worth of your attention. Especially with the sale price.\nWill update the review after investing more hours into it\n- A game that isnt afraid to be fun for the sake of it, a great game and one you dont see much anymore\n\nA great game to pick up after a long day of work, and you just want to hear some heavy rifts and kill some things.\n- DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. This game is a bloody masterpiece, it just takes the proper skill and knowledge to properly play it. There are proper real life mechanics which are fun as well as true to the real life process of making games. I personally have less than half an hour of experience with this game, showing that this is a captivating game that really draws you in and makes you beg for more. This is one of the games which will definitely be up there for GOTY. winkyface\n- I did not play this game, only the VR portion with a save game file I downloaded. I cannot stand third person over-the-shoulder cam games, and so I don't care about Ms. Tomb Raider. Frankly, after seeing her mansion, and hearing her stuck up voice, I kinda look upon her as a rich bitch, no matter how good she is at rock climbing.\n\nAs for the VR experience, it was pretty good overall, considering you can clearly tell it's a PSVR/PC thing, and so locomotion and playspace stuff is (almost necessarily) awkward. It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim. IIRC I finished it but had to cheat, or maybe gave up just before the end and watched the conclusion on youtube. If you skip all the book readings and narration (as I did) it will be an hour of hunting and pecking around the castle for objects and secret doors. Not too shabby really. [spoiler]I'd have never gotten to this if not for the save game file though, phew.[/spoiler]\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- \nI couldn't really decide if 'received the product for free' cheapens my review or gives it credibility.  I love this game, I loved testing this game, my kids loved testing this game.  The 53 hours listed at the time here is almost all actual play time.\n\nIf all it was, was the sheer joy of fast-moving with a web, slinging from one side of the screen to the next, it would be kind of fun and not knowing why you were doing it, but still doing it.  We've sat playing in the intro screen.  However to add the technique of throwing laser-sabres, timing bomb throws, that sweet rush of hitting an opposing spider with a mine --- this game is one of my all-time favorite couch coop game easily rivaling Ascention, Killer Queen Black, Samurai Gunn 2, or Boomerang-Fu.   It is indeed the pool a fly can drink from and an elephant can swim.\n\nMy kids (9 & 11) are absolutely ecstatic over it.  If they didn't know what they were doing initially, they made-do by swinging around and flailing with the weapons, still having a good time.  Eventually they managed to figure out how to force pull a laser saber after throwing it, and managing a kill on the return.   Online, while I'm pretty good at this, I haven't found I need to 'git gud'.   I can do a reasonable job against people who have practiced way more than I have and clearly have the moves to back it up.   This game is dad-compatible. \n\nYou really won't regret getting this game.  With multiplayer couch co-ops it's hard to know who has the goods as a great game and who is just \"well, with the right crowd, hitting each other with sticks is fun.\"   This definitely has the goods.  You want to flail and have fun, you can do it.   You want to get vicious and see how deep the pool of physics goes, you can do it.\n- [h1]THIS GAME HAS COMMUNITY SERVERS WITHOUT HACKERS.[/h1]\n\nI've been seeing a lot of reviews talking about this game being [i]\"infested with hackers, can't go a single game without hackers, hackers ruining everything\"[/i] etc. but I have yet to see a single hacker in any of my games because I play in community servers. I actually put off going back to this game for the longest time because of these reviews and thought there were only official servers, but I was completely wrong, [b]THERE ARE STILL ACTIVE COMMUNITY SERVERS WITH ADMINS ACTIVELY MONITORING FOR HACKERS.[/b]\n\nI genuinely don't understand why nobody is mentioning the fact that there are community servers, literally none of the top reviews say so. The only reason I didn't go back to this game any sooner was because of this one misconception, but to reiterate, [b]THERE ARE COMMUNITY SERVERS,[/b] just like Battlefield 4, which is the primary reason why BF4 is still alive to this day.\n\n[u]Completely ditch the matchmaking/official servers and just use the server browser,[/u] [b]I HAVE YET TO RUN INTO A SINGLE HACKER BECAUSE OF THIS.[/b] Anyone leaving a negative review because of \"hackers\" are probably still playing on official servers and are most likely just garbage at the game. [b]It's very easy to be really good at this game lmao.[/b]\n\n[u]The game is still very much alive and well without hackers[/u] and is one of the most fun/immersive FPS games ever made.\n\nEdit: I've played this game since launch on Origin and easily have over 200 hours, I only just this week started playing again on Steam for convenience, since low hours matters to some people lol.\n- If Level Editor is published in Just Shapes & Beats, This Game would be \"The Popular Music Game\"\nWe all like LEVEL EDITOR right?\n- If you want to play D&D but don't have friends, just get this game.\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- [h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!\n- ghrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... *shapeshifts into six pack sweaty wolf grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrolw  grrrrrrrrrrOOF rwooof woof *barks seductivley in public park brhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrr *foaming at the mouth ahsdf nrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrauoooooooooooo \n- Absolutely amazing. PLEASE don't judge this game based on how it looks. You must try it yourself! I thought it would be terrible but a friend convinced me to try it, and I'm glad he did. I haven't had so much fun in a game in a long time.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- No better CO-OP Experience, even decent solo, just remember the golden CO-OP rules:\n-Never push buttons without the whole team green lighting\n-Always Rock and Stone back\n-Never steal another dwarves drink. \n-Dont double dip Resupply pods without asking\n\n\nIf you choose to accept a contract with Deep Rock Galactic, good luck brother, see you in the caves.\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
