      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",
      "Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.",
      "I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",

      "Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",
      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
      "There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.",
      "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",

      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",
      "Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…",

      "[h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys.

In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one.

As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful.

I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better.

I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game.

      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",
      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]",
      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)",
      "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",
      "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",
      "Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.",
      "No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10",
      "There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.",
      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
      "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",

      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",

      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

      "Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.",
      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",

      "I don't think this was a very good game, at least for adults on PC.  And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.

      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity.

      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "Pretty alright for being free \nThe visuals are just so yucky tho.\nAlso I don’t understand why a match has to be 20 minutes long, that’s pretty insane and I wasn’t able to check out all the characters and their special abilities because it would take way too long. Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.",
      "Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice.

Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso ..

      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",
      "Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.",

It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last.

      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.",
      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",

      "I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.",

They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",

      "This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage. I hope the devs on this fall down a short but non lethal flight of concrete stairs that will make them go through as much therapy as i have wasted time on this game",
      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
      "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",
      "To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.",
      "I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.",

      "[h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).",
      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",
      "tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.",
      "As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10",

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- Finally a visual novel that allows me to pick my favourite man without it locking me out due to not completing every other route.

Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...\n- [b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.\n    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. \n    • Polyamory route.\n    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.\n    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.\n    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.\n    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one!

The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Alright. **Frog Detective 3: Corruption at Cowboy County** is done and dusted.\n\nIn this latest mystery for the *Frog Detective* to solve, somebody has....stolen...all the Cowboy County resident's....HATS!!! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651098\n\nWill you find the missing hats? Will you find the Hat Thief? These questions and more will be answered in this game!\n\nThis was actually the longest game in the series by a wide margin. Too about and hour forty to wrap up, and the game features two parts. The second part accessed after the credits roll.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067650496\n\nEpiside 3 was an excellent wrap up to the series. It is completely Steam Deck compatible. Also...doing sick scooter tricks around the desert is pretty sweet.\n\nThis one is an easy recommendation, and presumably, you will have played the other two games anyway, so you'll want to finish the series.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651219\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.  I like the idea of a creative LEGO diorama game, with slow and creative oriented gameplay.  As this one is though, I would only recommend it to a pre-teen LEGO fan with a lot of patience., or someone heavily medicated.\n\n- + a faithful, thoughtful rendition of the trilogy\n+ looks great and runs gorgeously\n- claiming ultrawide support with pillarboxed cutscenes in a dialogue heavy game\n- EA launcher gets in the way\n- Hi, I think there's been a mistake, when I open the programme it tells me that there's no game at all. Somehow, I still managed to find myself entertained for 4 hrs with beautiful graphics, intelligent puzzles and brilliant, soulful music.\nI'm only not asking for a refund because some mysterious voice requested me not to. (He sounded.. Russian)\nWould be happy if this could be fixed soon.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Pretty alright for being free \nThe visuals are just so yucky tho.\nAlso I don’t understand why a match has to be 20 minutes long, that’s pretty insane and I wasn’t able to check out all the characters and their special abilities because it would take way too long. Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.\n- Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- [h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- ... and G*d said let there be Mushihimesama. An extremely accessible and satisfying bullet hell vertical shooter developed by Cave Interactive which debuted on the PS2 and has been ported to multiple systems.   The Steam version controls perfectly, plays almost perfectly and looks satisfactory given its age.\n\nThree modes; Novice (highly accessible for beginners), Normal, Arrange, Ver. 1.5 (dlc)\nThree sub modes for each mode; Original, Maniac, Ultra.\n\nMultiple scoring strategies and works with direct input and xinput controllers, \n\nFull compliment of Steam Features;\n[list]\n[*]Plenty of achievements\n[*]Cloud saving\n[*]Trading Cards \n[*]Leader-boards\n[*]Remote Play TV / Together.\n[/list]\n\nNot only is Mushihimesama a fantastic game to experience, instilling a let's do that again after every play-through, Mushihimesama bleeds Starship Trooper vibes.  A remarkable vertical shooter which all shooter fans must experience.\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- UPDATE - EVERY positive review has little hours played, also the hours after review are none. Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage. I hope the devs on this fall down a short but non lethal flight of concrete stairs that will make them go through as much therapy as i have wasted time on this game\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- [h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
