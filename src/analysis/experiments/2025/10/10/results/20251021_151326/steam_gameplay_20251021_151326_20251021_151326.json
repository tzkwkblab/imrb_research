      "I played OT1 before OT2 and, unlike most people, I really enjoyed it and didn't really understand all the hate around it. \nAfter reading multiple times that \"OT2 is so much better than OT1,\" I just couldn't see how an already fantastic IP could get any better, so I bought this game.\n\nAnd now I see it.\n\nThey took Octopath Traveler 1 and cranked everything up to 11. The world is gorgeous, detailed and worth exploring. The stories are exciting and incredibly well written. The combat has seen many changes, increasing the skill ceiling and giving the player more options and strategies to work with. The OST is quite frankly a masterpiece, simple as that. \n\nThere's so much more to say about this fantastic game and all the improvements and changes they made, but it will be much better if you see it for yourself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, even at full price. 8/8",
      "One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.",

      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",
      "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.",
      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",
      "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",
      "I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.",
      "It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun. The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.",
      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",

They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",
      "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",

      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",

      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",
      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",
      "I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.",
      "Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported!

      "The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.",

What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones.

      "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",

      "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",

      "Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.\n\nYou can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone.",

      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",

      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

      "   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.",

This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to.

      "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",

That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",

      "The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.",
      "A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.",

      "This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack.

Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu).

You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",

      "Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.",

      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",

      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",

      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",

There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it.

You recieve:\nBad AI, bad animations, online only*, no mod support, no varying sound cues, music where??, characters with zero personality, tacked on weapon modding with guns that all feel the same, no environmental physics, unfair director (spawning 40 tallboys at start of map)\n(*otherwise no progression)\n\nL4D1 & 2 - 8.19 euro each (often on sale for 1.99-2.99 each). You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.\n- I played OT1 before OT2 and, unlike most people, I really enjoyed it and didn't really understand all the hate around it. \nAfter reading multiple times that \"OT2 is so much better than OT1,\" I just couldn't see how an already fantastic IP could get any better, so I bought this game.\n\nAnd now I see it.\n\nThey took Octopath Traveler 1 and cranked everything up to 11. The world is gorgeous, detailed and worth exploring. The stories are exciting and incredibly well written. The combat has seen many changes, increasing the skill ceiling and giving the player more options and strategies to work with. The OST is quite frankly a masterpiece, simple as that. \n\nThere's so much more to say about this fantastic game and all the improvements and changes they made, but it will be much better if you see it for yourself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, even at full price. 8/8\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.\n- It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun. The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- [h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on. Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n...

Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data.

F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you.

SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!\n- An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban. Highly recommended and see more details in this review:\n[quote zholobov]A very good recursive Sokoban.

This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.\n\nYou can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- One word to describe this game: cheap\n-cheap level design\n-cheap story\n-cheap hit boxes\n-cheap enemy placement(''just make them fight 6 enemies at one'')\n-cheap enviroments (The Grand Drangleic Castle, f*ckers could't even model the bridge to go all the way down so you can clearly see it floating)\n-cheap boss fight (''what is Dark Souls knows for?'' ''It's hard?'' ''I heard that too, how can we make this boss harder?'' ''I dunno add another exact one for this one, 6 more for this one, have a lot of poison in the arena for this one'')\n\nJust don't, get 1 or 3 instead of this.\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n\n【グループB】\n- For every like this review gets, I will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise\n-    I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.\n- DO NOT LET OTHERS FOOL YOU!.\n\nI have been playing Souls games since before there were souls games.\n\nThe remaster of DS1 is not perfect. But it is a very good way to play the game again with new or even old friends who also love the franchise.\n\nMy current PC specs are:\ni5-6500\nGTX1060 3gb\n24g DDR4\nAsus Maximus Hero 8 mobo\n\nI get a constant 60fps while in 2k resolution in EVERY ZONE of the game. No dips, no stuttering, no tearing.\nThere are some misaligned textures in spots but it is nothing you will see unless you know where to look.\n\nHave yet to run into any cheaters!. \n\nFUN FACT!: If you know of any of the more \"well known\" cheaters?, goto their steam profile and block all communications. It will not allow them to join into your world as the game runs on steam's client servers.\n\nIf you love the souls games. If you already own DS1?, IT IS WORTH the $25 dollars (CAD) to experience it all again and this time with friends and better fps!.\n- Your girlfriend might be temporary but DOOM is ETERNAL!\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- What should i say, the dream has come true.\nKept us waiting, huh.\n\n---\nOLD REVIEW JUST FOR DOCUMENTATION\n\nif you're new, here's your list of the main games\n\nmetal gear (msx)\nmetal gear 2 (msx)\nmetal gear solid (ps1)\nmetal gear solid 2 sons of liberty (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 3 snake eater (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 4 guns of the patriots (ps3)\nmetal gear rising: revengeance (pc)\nmetal gear solid peace walker hd (ps3)\nmetal gear solid v ground zeroes (pc)\nmetal gear solid v the phantom pain (pc)\n\n*: mgs2 and mgs3 have a ps3/x360 HD ver.\n*: there is also mgs2: substance and mgs3: subsistence which are expanded editions: the former has bonus VR missions, snake tales, skateboarding and extras. and the latter includes extra content + metal gear 1 and 2.\n\nthank you for all the mem(es)ories kojima san!\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- they should pay me to be playing this lmao\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- i thought it is overpriced eventhough its good, but it am wrong, \nall ascpects in the game are well made with high quality.\nspecial thanks to accessibility setting, very thoughtful for players.\nand it runs perfeclty in steam deck\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
