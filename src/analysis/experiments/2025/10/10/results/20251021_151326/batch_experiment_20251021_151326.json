          "I played OT1 before OT2 and, unlike most people, I really enjoyed it and didn't really understand all the hate around it. \nAfter reading multiple times that \"OT2 is so much better than OT1,\" I just couldn't see how an already fantastic IP could get any better, so I bought this game.\n\nAnd now I see it.\n\nThey took Octopath Traveler 1 and cranked everything up to 11. The world is gorgeous, detailed and worth exploring. The stories are exciting and incredibly well written. The combat has seen many changes, increasing the skill ceiling and giving the player more options and strategies to work with. The OST is quite frankly a masterpiece, simple as that. \n\nThere's so much more to say about this fantastic game and all the improvements and changes they made, but it will be much better if you see it for yourself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, even at full price. 8/8",

          "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short.

          "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric.

If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",
          "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.",
          "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
          "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",
          "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",
          "I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.",
          "It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun.

          "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",

Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings.

Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",
          "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",

          "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",

          "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

          "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
          "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
          "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",
          "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",
          "I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.",

It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported!

Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough.

          "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",

          "Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.",
          "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",

          "Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.\n\nYou can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone.",

          "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",

          "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

          "   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.",

It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to.

          "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",

That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",

It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.",

The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.",

          "This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.",
          "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive.

Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",

          "Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom.

          "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",

          "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",

In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware.

You recieve:\nBad AI, bad animations, online only*, no mod support, no varying sound cues, music where??, characters with zero personality, tacked on weapon modding with guns that all feel the same, no environmental physics, unfair director (spawning 40 tallboys at start of map)\n(*otherwise no progression)\n\nL4D1 & 2 - 8.19 euro each (often on sale for 1.99-2.99 each). You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.\n- I played OT1 before OT2 and, unlike most people, I really enjoyed it and didn't really understand all the hate around it. \nAfter reading multiple times that \"OT2 is so much better than OT1,\" I just couldn't see how an already fantastic IP could get any better, so I bought this game.\n\nAnd now I see it.\n\nThey took Octopath Traveler 1 and cranked everything up to 11. The world is gorgeous, detailed and worth exploring. The stories are exciting and incredibly well written. The combat has seen many changes, increasing the skill ceiling and giving the player more options and strategies to work with. The OST is quite frankly a masterpiece, simple as that. \n\nThere's so much more to say about this fantastic game and all the improvements and changes they made, but it will be much better if you see it for yourself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, even at full price. 8/8\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- I really wanted to like it, but i can't, in good faith, recommend A Space for the Unbound to anyone. It's a crying shame, because i deeply respect the intention behind the project. I love the whimsical, yet somewhat grounded premise: anyone who likes Makoto Shinkai movies will feel right at home. The intrigue, even though the plot twists are fairly obvious, still creates an unsettling feeling of uncertainty and dread that clashes (in a good way) with cheerful, bright colors of youth. A Space for the Unbound is mainly a point-and-click quest, but the developers still tried to spice the gameplay up a little with mini-games and little one-off mechanics that successfully break up the monotony.\n\nAnd yet... For every memorable, emotional peak A Space for the Unbound presents an hour of pure, unadulterated filler. Almost every \"puzzle\" is a multi-step fetch quest that requires you to backtrack multiple times with no other reason than to pad the length of the gameplay sections. It also indulges in \"gotcha\" moments, where the game deliberately fools you into the wrong solution, while the right one, of course, requires you to back track somewhere. Yes, the hometown of our main heroes is not that big, but that's hardly an excuse. Even more so in numerous dream sequences, where you are often times forced to go back and forth between someone's mind and reality to collect key items. Spacedives represent a wonderful opportunity to do something different, but A Space for the Unbound rarely delivers on that front.\n\nMost people praise the game for the story, the characters and the fact that it was made in Indonesia -- an under-represented region when it comes to games. But neither of those three have any solid writing to stand on their own. Sure, Atma and Raya can be sweet, but developers never allow their relationship to truly blossom. There's almost no banter, she's not even a constant presence in the story. Raya is important to the world of A Space for the Unbound, but doesn't really feel important to the player. Yes, the game tries really hard to tug at your heartstrings, but more often than not does so in a terribly hamfisted manner. It's supposed to be so profound and melodramatic that, at a certain point, it becomes difficult to take the game seriously.\n\nOh, and speaking of representing the community, A Space for the Unbound doesn't do a good job. The town itself is cute and full of life, there's no argument about that, but all of its inhabintants are either nameless mannequins with a so-so pixel-art, or just item bots. You speak to them once or twice, they give you what you need to advance the plot, and that's it. The fact that the game forces you to run laps around the town on an endless search for items doesn't make it any more charming or cozy. While, on the other hand, the authors only briefly touch on real societal issues, so as not to spoil the whimsy. In short, it's a huge nothingburger of a letdown, despite the fact that the whole setting is clearly supposed to be warm and nostalgic.\n\nYes, you can excuse some of those flaws by the main plot twist, which i will not spoild. But while it does make certain things more clear in hindsight, again, it does not portray the story in a good light. A Space for the Unbound really wants to be a Makoto Shinkai movie by way of Night in the Woods, but falls tragically short wherever you look. However, despite my criticisms, i hope Mojiken will not stop making games. It is very clear that the devs have tremendous passion and some talent on display -- it just needs refinement.\n- It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun. The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- [h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on. Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n...

Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data.

F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you.

SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!\n- An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban. Highly recommended and see more details in this review:\n[quote zholobov]A very good recursive Sokoban.

This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.\n\nYou can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- One word to describe this game: cheap\n-cheap level design\n-cheap story\n-cheap hit boxes\n-cheap enemy placement(''just make them fight 6 enemies at one'')\n-cheap enviroments (The Grand Drangleic Castle, f*ckers could't even model the bridge to go all the way down so you can clearly see it floating)\n-cheap boss fight (''what is Dark Souls knows for?'' ''It's hard?'' ''I heard that too, how can we make this boss harder?'' ''I dunno add another exact one for this one, 6 more for this one, have a lot of poison in the arena for this one'')\n\nJust don't, get 1 or 3 instead of this.\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way.

Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n\n【グループB】\n- For every like this review gets, I will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise\n-    I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.\n- DO NOT LET OTHERS FOOL YOU!.\n\nI have been playing Souls games since before there were souls games.\n\nThe remaster of DS1 is not perfect. But it is a very good way to play the game again with new or even old friends who also love the franchise.\n\nMy current PC specs are:\ni5-6500\nGTX1060 3gb\n24g DDR4\nAsus Maximus Hero 8 mobo\n\nI get a constant 60fps while in 2k resolution in EVERY ZONE of the game. No dips, no stuttering, no tearing.\nThere are some misaligned textures in spots but it is nothing you will see unless you know where to look.\n\nHave yet to run into any cheaters!. \n\nFUN FACT!: If you know of any of the more \"well known\" cheaters?, goto their steam profile and block all communications. It will not allow them to join into your world as the game runs on steam's client servers.\n\nIf you love the souls games. If you already own DS1?, IT IS WORTH the $25 dollars (CAD) to experience it all again and this time with friends and better fps!.\n- Your girlfriend might be temporary but DOOM is ETERNAL!\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- What should i say, the dream has come true.\nKept us waiting, huh.\n\n---\nOLD REVIEW JUST FOR DOCUMENTATION\n\nif you're new, here's your list of the main games\n\nmetal gear (msx)\nmetal gear 2 (msx)\nmetal gear solid (ps1)\nmetal gear solid 2 sons of liberty (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 3 snake eater (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 4 guns of the patriots (ps3)\nmetal gear rising: revengeance (pc)\nmetal gear solid peace walker hd (ps3)\nmetal gear solid v ground zeroes (pc)\nmetal gear solid v the phantom pain (pc)\n\n*: mgs2 and mgs3 have a ps3/x360 HD ver.\n*: there is also mgs2: substance and mgs3: subsistence which are expanded editions: the former has bonus VR missions, snake tales, skateboarding and extras. and the latter includes extra content + metal gear 1 and 2.\n\nthank you for all the mem(es)ories kojima san!\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- they should pay me to be playing this lmao\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.\n- i thought it is overpriced eventhough its good, but it am wrong, \nall ascpects in the game are well made with high quality.\nspecial thanks to accessibility setting, very thoughtful for players.\nand it runs perfeclty in steam deck\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him.

This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

          "The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]",
          "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.",

          "Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.",

THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n",
          "[h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading!

          "In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.",

          "I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.",
          "Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.",
          "Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.",
          "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",

          "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",
          "[h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.",
          "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
          "1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.",
          "To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.",
          "One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.",
          "First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.",
          "I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!",
          "Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy.

          "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

          "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy.

I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game.

          "As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!",
          "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",
          "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
          "To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n",

          "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
          "Pros:\nGreat movement/mechanics\nEasy to pickup, really hard to master. \nSoundtrack is 10/10. \nVoice actors are high quality, \nNeon Red. \n\nCons: \nyou need an acquired taste of deep fried cringe to get through some of the dialogue",
          "Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4",
          "Gameplay is similar to Hades. The story isn't as rich as Hades, but it's still pretty good. More forgiving than Hades, that's for sure. You see where I'm going with this - Hades is 10/10, the roguelike to compare/to beat. On a scale of 10 hades, I'd give this game a 7.5/10 Hades.",
          "Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.",
          "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",
          "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
          "Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.",
          "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",

          "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
          "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",
          "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",

          "This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!",
          "Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium."

          "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth.

What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",
          "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it.

          "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",

          "Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm.

          "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",

          "I was waiting to be a bit further into the game to give my thoughts on some of the early complaints I've seen cropping up around this game.\n\nFrankly I do not think this game will be for everyone, but some of the people leaving negative reviews are morons.\n\nNo progression in this game is not locked behind story progress. There are several ways the game marks player progression, and while story progression is one of them. The reward track, gear, and gems are the other. You can consider all of this side-content in some way. You mostly make additional progress through exploration and side quests in this game. Each time you enter a new area you're given several tasks on a reward track that allow you to gain SP to level up your skills, and the reward material that allows you to learn new skills. As you learn new skills your character's stats go up. Exploration and sidequests also allow you to gain unique materials that you sell to merchants that open up deals that allow you to buy high level equipment that give large power boosts to your party. The gem system allows you to slot  gear with upgrades to further customize your characters, and all weapons/armor are able to be upgraded twice.\n\nIf you go out of your way to find the hidden treasures, beat the unique monsters, and finish side quests you can sort of trounce the challenges in this game. Class Emblems which give 'very' large power boosts are also hidden out of the way sometimes. You really just have to search for them, but by no means are they necessary.  I have had no difficulty at all in this game. It's relatively easy to grasp, but it does ask you to pay attention a little more than most JRPGs. If you interact with the systems the game has then the progression curve is smooth. If you don't -- that's not really the game's fault.\n\nOn the subject of the Overdrive Bar. Once you get into it the upper left corner will ask you to use a SINGLE move to help maintain the bar. It will ask you to use either: A physical attack, magic attack, buff, debuff, or utility spell. It is not hard to throw in one of these during the party's turn, and you very much can spam moves over and over again. The system is not at all that obtrusive, again, you just have to pay attention. \n\nIf for some reason all of this is not good enough for a player on a baseline level. There are accessibility options that allow you to adjust how aggressive enemies are, how high their stats are, and you can even make the overdrive bar extremely more forgiving. \n\nThe world is well crafted, the story is fine thus far, the combat is fun and it does try some new things. I certainly appreciate the experience for what it is. The price they're charging for this game feels absolutely criminal, and there's clearly a lot of love put into it. Give it a shot.",
          "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.",

The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want.

          "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",
          "Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay.

          "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",

          "Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.",

          "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",

If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!",
          "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails.

          "2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project",

        "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- [h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading! Please leave a comment if you feel I have left anything of importance out or if you just want to share your thoughts. Cheers!\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.\n- This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.\n- Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- [h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- 1 week before release i played the demo, it was a 20 minutes demo that was very underwhelming, but i still thought i should give the game a chance to see if it gets better later on.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nSo the first thing i read about this game in the embed of the steam link was \"a fresh take on the jrpg genre\", and its probably the biggest problem of the game. It is really the most basic, mediocre turn base combat you can find.\n\nTurn base combat, rock paper scissor elemental types plus physical, materia base skills with few spots (i had only 4 skills activated),  no gear, no party. Does that sound like a fresh take to you?\n\nSo if the gameplay is so barebones it means is at least hard right? Well no, it is basic and easy. The start is easy, in the mid part they blow up the HP of enemies so you understand you should buy new skills, and once you do it the game is easy again. Mob enemies are generally harder than bosses because you are 1vs3 most of the time, while in bosses you can just debuff it and make it slow, while you have 2 turns to spam healings and hitting. There also some questionable decisions on the minor mechanics of the combat system but i don't think they matter (see some paragraphs below)\n\nNow here is what is really the \"fresh take\": the setting being cyberpunk. Everything is written with tech terminology. The mana is called data, block and delay turn is called cache, melee combat is called hack? some of the terms don't even make sense of what they actually do. Also because we obviously live in a technological society we have people called \"V-sync\" or \"Nullpointer\", expresions like \"Digits!\" or \"Oh my grind!\", you know, normal behaviour if you ask me.\n\nThe story is pretty standard for a futuristic setting, it wasn't bad but also it wasn't good, pretty normal.\n\nThe artstyle is cool, the music is generally cool, which i think its why most people would don't mind the boring gameplay and will just play for the story, which is also present in the game itself because you have options to either skip every random encounter (yeah we have those here) or to insta win every battle when you want it.\n\nSo if you want to try this game because of the \"fresh take in the jrpg genre\" you will be disappointed, if you have played jrpgs before there is nothing new in this game, you have already played it before.\n- To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- Pros:\nGreat movement/mechanics\nEasy to pickup, really hard to master. \nSoundtrack is 10/10. \nVoice actors are high quality, \nNeon Red. \n\nCons: \nyou need an acquired taste of deep fried cringe to get through some of the dialogue\n- Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4\n- Gameplay is similar to Hades. The story isn't as rich as Hades, but it's still pretty good. More forgiving than Hades, that's for sure. You see where I'm going with this - Hades is 10/10, the roguelike to compare/to beat. On a scale of 10 hades, I'd give this game a 7.5/10 Hades.\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- One word to describe this game: cheap\n-cheap level design\n-cheap story\n-cheap hit boxes\n-cheap enemy placement(''just make them fight 6 enemies at one'')\n-cheap enviroments (The Grand Drangleic Castle, f*ckers could't even model the bridge to go all the way down so you can clearly see it floating)\n-cheap boss fight (''what is Dark Souls knows for?'' ''It's hard?'' ''I heard that too, how can we make this boss harder?'' ''I dunno add another exact one for this one, 6 more for this one, have a lot of poison in the arena for this one'')\n\nJust don't, get 1 or 3 instead of this.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.\n\n【グループB】\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- All I have to say, is 1 word. Wow. \n\nThis game is just us kids back in the early to mid 90's playing Chorno Trigger all over again. But instead being kids, we transformed to \"boring\" adults. \n\nAnd one of those kids, wanted another Chrono Trigger 2, but the big adults said \"NO!\" So one the kids, promised to everyone, one day, they will make another game just like CT, and everyone will be happy with joy. \n\nFast forward to 2023, and the dream is indeed real. \n\nThis game screams nostalgia for those fans. Nothing but amazing from what I've played from the demo. \n\nThe game also has this this subtle love for Lunar Silver Star Story. With the love of exploring /adventures. \n\nWhich is alone makes me fan. \n\nThe gameplay is just so rich, and very fun. You can't just sit there and press 1 button to attack. No. You have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus, and do some combos. Neat idea to stay on your 2 feet. \n\nThe music really good. Capture the world you're playing. \n\nTo every team who worked on this game, just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy. \n\n5 stars from what I've played, and if you're a fan of old school JRPG, then you owe to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry. \n\n\n\nHopefully Top 5 games this year for me? \n\nSea Of Stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself. \n\nBig Thumbs Up indeed!\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- Just another pay to win city builder. If you like this kind of thing that's fine but I get rather bored waiting for the extremely slow build times. I'm not going to throw thousands of dollars on a game like this.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- Would be really fun if not developed by retards. not only they thought its a good idea to make 1 button to do 3 DIFERENT ACTIONS, LIKE BLOCKING, BOW, WEIRD VISION,(THAT ONLY KILLS ME LIKE EVERY TIME AS INSTEAM OF BLOCKING HE PULLS BOW) but has a FORCED autoaiming, that f you up every time it can. FORCED AUTO AIMING IN 2014 DO DEVELOPERS TAKE PLAYERS FOR RETARDS!? No only this is insulting but also making game harder than it should be!\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- UPDATE - EVERY positive review has little hours played, also the hours after review are none. Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- This is Wario Land but fast. All the fortnite zoomers are gonna play this and talk about it like Fight Night Fungus ft. Frederick Leopold Fazbearington while nobody's gonna play the Wario Land games :(((( \n\nTLDR: Fire. Goku fortnite. My nuts hang :(\n- I was waiting to be a bit further into the game to give my thoughts on some of the early complaints I've seen cropping up around this game.\n\nFrankly I do not think this game will be for everyone, but some of the people leaving negative reviews are morons.\n\nNo progression in this game is not locked behind story progress. There are several ways the game marks player progression, and while story progression is one of them. The reward track, gear, and gems are the other. You can consider all of this side-content in some way. You mostly make additional progress through exploration and side quests in this game. Each time you enter a new area you're given several tasks on a reward track that allow you to gain SP to level up your skills, and the reward material that allows you to learn new skills. As you learn new skills your character's stats go up. Exploration and sidequests also allow you to gain unique materials that you sell to merchants that open up deals that allow you to buy high level equipment that give large power boosts to your party. The gem system allows you to slot  gear with upgrades to further customize your characters, and all weapons/armor are able to be upgraded twice.\n\nIf you go out of your way to find the hidden treasures, beat the unique monsters, and finish side quests you can sort of trounce the challenges in this game. Class Emblems which give 'very' large power boosts are also hidden out of the way sometimes. You really just have to search for them, but by no means are they necessary.  I have had no difficulty at all in this game. It's relatively easy to grasp, but it does ask you to pay attention a little more than most JRPGs. If you interact with the systems the game has then the progression curve is smooth. If you don't -- that's not really the game's fault.\n\nOn the subject of the Overdrive Bar. Once you get into it the upper left corner will ask you to use a SINGLE move to help maintain the bar. It will ask you to use either: A physical attack, magic attack, buff, debuff, or utility spell. It is not hard to throw in one of these during the party's turn, and you very much can spam moves over and over again. The system is not at all that obtrusive, again, you just have to pay attention. \n\nIf for some reason all of this is not good enough for a player on a baseline level. There are accessibility options that allow you to adjust how aggressive enemies are, how high their stats are, and you can even make the overdrive bar extremely more forgiving. \n\nThe world is well crafted, the story is fine thus far, the combat is fun and it does try some new things. I certainly appreciate the experience for what it is. The price they're charging for this game feels absolutely criminal, and there's clearly a lot of love put into it. Give it a shot.\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!! AND NOT THE SAME TWO TIMING PUZZLES YOU GOT IT? YOU WILL DO THIS OK I love pizza tower :)\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- I'm an atheist, and even this game made me pray to God to make it stop.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid... AND they let you actually clean the rooms. i have been asking for this for years and years and then these psychopaths go and actually make it?? unfathomable. love it. my only critique is that I can't high five Eugene or take Wendy to the malt shop to help her feel better\n\nin seriousness it's not the most wildly divergent choice-based narrative of all time (there are small choices throughout that have an impact, but most of the consequence is delayed so it doesn't FEEL as impactful in the moment), which might put off some people who want a more sandbox feeling. consider it more of a detective game than an RPG. worth experiencing even if you don't have my particular brand of mental illness tho, 100%, especially if you like these kinds of games in general.\n- Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- Over 240 hours, 1500+ runs, I've completed this game a measely 12 times. This is one of the most difficult games I've ever played. The seconds are minutes and minutes are hours when you're playing this game.  I've been to Hell once and I only just recently finished it under 8 minutes. This game hasn't gotten stale yet but it will make you feel every emotion ten fold.\n\nUPDATE after 519 hours of gameplay. I have unlocked all of the achievements, even  the dreaded \"no gold\" one. I have completed this game countless times now, yet I still can't understate how difficult this game is. The hours I have spent in this game were well spent and for the price you're getting it for it's a steal....just don't steal from the shopkeeper.\n\nAnd to the people complaining it is too hard, Spelunky is meant to be difficult, that's the challenge and the point of it.\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.\n- i bought a fighting game and ended up playing dress-up\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- BE ADVISED!!!\nif u are from asia, just don't buy it! there is no server for us.\nwe can't found any server even from EU & NA\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.\n- Such a neat concept!  Clear the table under so many \"strokes\".  Where it really shines, however, is all of the surreal bits you can add into your game like giant balls, conveyor belts, or balls that split when hit.  The game always has many challenges to complete that will require you to use the indicated table/ball/modifier and meet its requirements on your run (like make 3 long shots in a single run or pot multiple balls in a single shot).  Complete enough of these challenges and you'll unlock the next feature, but the game gives you a lot of freedom in which modifers you'll use in your run to increase your odds of completing the given challenge.\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- The fact that you can't pause the game during cutscenes and conversations, is very frustrating. The cinematics are long (and sometimes exhausting). If your baby wakes up, If your phone rings, if someone's at the door, if you need to take a pan out of the oven... you can't pause the game! What's the deal with that? Put a pause feature! We have the technology!\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails.

(I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

          "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
          "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",
          "Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything.

          "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
          "Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.",
          "I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",

          "Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",
          "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
          "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
          "There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.",
          "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",

          "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
          "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",
          "Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…",

If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me.

In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation.

As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one!

          "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
          "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",
          "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails.

          "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)",
          "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",
          "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",
          "Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.",
          "No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10",
          "There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.",
          "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
          "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
          "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",

          "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
          "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",

And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.",
          "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
          "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
          "Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.",
          "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
          "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
          "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

          "Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.",
          "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",

          "I don't think this was a very good game, at least for adults on PC.  And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.  I like the idea of a creative LEGO diorama game, with slow and creative oriented gameplay.  As this one is though, I would only recommend it to a pre-teen LEGO fan with a lot of patience., or someone heavily medicated.\n",

          "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity.

          "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",

Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score.

Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",
          "Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.",

          "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
          "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",

I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.",
          "First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!",
          "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
          "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",

          "This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage. I hope the devs on this fall down a short but non lethal flight of concrete stairs that will make them go through as much therapy as i have wasted time on this game",
          "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
          "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",
          "To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.",

          "[h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).",
          "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",

          "As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD.

It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- Did you like the first two chapters?\nWell, here we have everything and tons of new and improved things, like the 2nd chapter did with regards to the first one (which was awesome, but quite simple gameplay-wise).\nA classical turn-based strategy game, now more polished than ever with wave-like combats and tons of units to start with, to upgrade and well, we don't even have real classes here - more correctly, each hero is a class on its own and has different abilities and such.\nThe story follows always the same one-way saga and you'll have to make lots of choices determining your fate, your battles and so on; the graphics are the most beautiful I've ever seen here and the soundtrack is quite amazing and atmospheric too.\nYou'll have also many features like arena combat, and a great history re-telling if you don't remember the first two chapters, plus a great tutorial to start with even if you're not new to the series and the genre.\nIt's quite fundamental if you're a little bit interested in this awesome story to play the other chapters - here in fact we'll start with all the old heroes, all the story right back from the caravan that reached Arberrang.\nWe're basically reviewing one of the best strategy tactical turn-based role-playing games of the last 5-10 years and I won't add more than this, it has already thousands of reviews and mine is quite useless I think. \nLots of endings, lots of characters to explore and promote, lots of weapons, accessories, modes.. we have everything. Recommended to anyone (maybe with a little discount).\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- Finally a visual novel that allows me to pick my favourite man without it locking me out due to not completing every other route. Limbo here I come baby\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...\n- [b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one.

As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful.

I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better.

I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall. It was a lot of fun and very geeky.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page,\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome Lovers[/url], if you'd like to see\nmore reviews like this one!

The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Alright. **Frog Detective 3: Corruption at Cowboy County** is done and dusted.\n\nIn this latest mystery for the *Frog Detective* to solve, somebody has....stolen...all the Cowboy County resident's....HATS!!! \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651098\n\nWill you find the missing hats? Will you find the Hat Thief? These questions and more will be answered in this game!\n\nThis was actually the longest game in the series by a wide margin. Too about and hour forty to wrap up, and the game features two parts. The second part accessed after the credits roll.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067650496\n\nEpiside 3 was an excellent wrap up to the series. It is completely Steam Deck compatible. Also...doing sick scooter tricks around the desert is pretty sweet.\n\nThis one is an easy recommendation, and presumably, you will have played the other two games anyway, so you'll want to finish the series.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3067651219\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.  I like the idea of a creative LEGO diorama game, with slow and creative oriented gameplay.  As this one is though, I would only recommend it to a pre-teen LEGO fan with a lot of patience., or someone heavily medicated.\n\n- + a faithful, thoughtful rendition of the trilogy\n+ looks great and runs gorgeously\n- claiming ultrawide support with pillarboxed cutscenes in a dialogue heavy game\n- EA launcher gets in the way\n- Hi, I think there's been a mistake, when I open the programme it tells me that there's no game at all. Somehow, I still managed to find myself entertained for 4 hrs with beautiful graphics, intelligent puzzles and brilliant, soulful music.\nI'm only not asking for a refund because some mysterious voice requested me not to. (He sounded.. Russian)\nWould be happy if this could be fixed soon.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Pretty alright for being free \nThe visuals are just so yucky tho.\nAlso I don’t understand why a match has to be 20 minutes long, that’s pretty insane and I wasn’t able to check out all the characters and their special abilities because it would take way too long. Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.\n- Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- \"You've played for 1000 hours. Would you recommend this game to other players?\"\n- [h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- ... and G*d said let there be Mushihimesama. An extremely accessible and satisfying bullet hell vertical shooter developed by Cave Interactive which debuted on the PS2 and has been ported to multiple systems.   The Steam version controls perfectly, plays almost perfectly and looks satisfactory given its age.\n\nThree modes; Novice (highly accessible for beginners), Normal, Arrange, Ver. 1.5 (dlc)\nThree sub modes for each mode; Original, Maniac, Ultra.\n\nMultiple scoring strategies and works with direct input and xinput controllers, \n\nFull compliment of Steam Features;\n[list]\n[*]Plenty of achievements\n[*]Cloud saving\n[*]Trading Cards \n[*]Leader-boards\n[*]Remote Play TV / Together.\n[/list]\n\nNot only is Mushihimesama a fantastic game to experience, instilling a let's do that again after every play-through, Mushihimesama bleeds Starship Trooper vibes.  A remarkable vertical shooter which all shooter fans must experience.\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- UPDATE - EVERY positive review has little hours played, also the hours after review are none. Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage. I hope the devs on this fall down a short but non lethal flight of concrete stairs that will make them go through as much therapy as i have wasted time on this game\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.\n- To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- [h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
