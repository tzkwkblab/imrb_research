"The switch worked initially but a fatal problem developed within hours. On one of the ports, both lights lit continuously even with no plug in the port, and nothing connected to it on any port could communicate through it. There is nothing to configure, fix, or tweak. It doesn't even have an on/off switch-- it either works, or it doesn't.Like most Netgear products, the unit is built (on the outside) like a tank and has the appearance of durability but, of course, what counts is on the inside.

I have had this unit (DI-701) for a year or so and recently found a problem in addition to the security hole thats posted here.I upgraded to the newest firmware 4.10 because I needed the IPSec protocol that the 4.06 didnt have and it seems to work fine until I tried to access Netflix.com. The unit totally halts. All lights stay on and the unit cannot be found through its configurator. I have to recycle the power to the unit to get it back up and running again.I called tech support and they told me to call Netflix and ask them what ports they are using to send back http requests. I told him that Netflix didnt have a tech support since they do not provide hardware. And it shouldn't be the case since I was able to access Netflix with the 4.06 firmware.

Sometimes cheap is good. You go a long way with your buck. With this machine I ended up spending more money since it malfunctioned ever since the beginning.

"Have used the Fine Pix for 8-months now.My PERSONAL experience with it:Pluses: Reliable, easy to operate, nice combination of features, small and handy (but see below), battery life: ok for about 25-35 pictures.Minuses: Have to work hard to get sharp pictures - usually I do not succeed; not really  a 'pocket' camera; red-eye reduction never worked with my kids.Overall: If you can get it for $300 it is a good deal, current price of $500+ seems too expansive for what you get.",2.0,B00004TH2X,1009843200,Ok but not fine!
"At first blush, this unit looks promising (keeping in mind that one shouldn't expect miracles given the selling price, etc.). One of the cassette mechanisms on this particular TEAC W-600R developed a loud electronic hum (which had also translated to the Recording as well as the Playback mode) after only 3 weeks of extremely light use - a virtual out-of-box failure. I returned the item for a replacement (ever the Optimist or simply too stupid to know better) and am awaiting the new unit. I must add that, unfortunately, my experience with TEAC products has always been disappointing at best (at present, I have 3 TEAC products and all suffer from a malfunction of some sort on at least one of the features). I actually purchased this W-600R to ""replace"" (via AUX) the suddenly non-functioning cassete decks on my TEAC DC-D2831 Compact Hi-Fi System (rather than trash the whole System). Those just quit out-of-the-blue. These failures seem to happen too regularly to attribute to a series of coincidences. Just saying ""beware"", I suppose.

I use it and its ok but I would really like to find a 10 foot iPad cord that actually works and not rely on thsi thing.

These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.,2.0,B00000J1EJ,1005177600,Depends on the type of noise

"It's a nice looking rig and it worked OK with a folding HT antenna affixed to the top.  I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it.  I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roof-mount antenna.  Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles (verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end).As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio's jack, the radio's jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack.  This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn't screw on more than 1/2 turn.  This is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of QC.I sent it back for a refund.  Spend another $35 to get a full-size name brand CB that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier.",2.0,B00000K2YR,1327881600,I Sent It Back

"The Sony Mavica was my first color digital camera.  Although I took a lot of pictures with it, I eventually bought another digital camera.  The biggest problems with the Mavica are.1. The resolution - 640 by 480 just  isn't good enough.  If you do any photo editing at all, the quality suffers  because of the low resolution.  You need at least a 1200 by 800-1000  resolution, preferably more.2.  The LCD is too hard to use, especially  in strong light.  You really need a viewfinder.3.  The floppys just  don't store enough.  If you go on vacation, you need to carry a bunch of  extra floppies in your pocket.On the plus  side, the battery life and 10x zoom are great.

"I bought a Nook today. The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.",3.0,1400599997,1296086400,Kindle lover jumps ship for a few hours

"(update) I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page. Some browsers have the option to add a bookmark to Home, but this never seemed to work in Nook HD. I think I now understand the source of the problem. The default Nook HD launcher (with carousel) ignores them. The work around is to install the Nova launcher, and it will show them on the home screens.",3.0,1400501776,1374796800,"Cheap way to browse web and run android apps on a fast, beautiful display"
"These headphones are good for the price, but nowadays you can find better ones.Why are these some of the best in the $10-$15 price range?* Very good sound quality, especially in treble range* Sturdy, long cable with adapter* They don't break easily (though they're still made of cheap plastic)* They're extremely light (still, that reflects on their plastic construction)That much being said, they don't stand up too well to higher priced headphones. Here's why:* The bass/mid/treble balance is off; low midrange is a bit quiet* The seal on the headphones is not good at all, so you hear ambient noise and others hear your music playing* The flexible design does not always align itself properly* They require quite a  lot of power from portable devicesSo, there you have it. These are good headphones in their price range. However, if you're willing to pay a bit more (perhaps some $20-$30 on Sennheisers or Sonys), you'll get much better bass/mid/treble balance, better build quality (not necessarily better sound quality, though), and generally a better seal around your ears.

"The only reason that I use this charger is in case I have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful Maha MH-C801D charger.

The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging.

"My husband bought this to expand a Canon T1i (dslr), that just had the kit lens. No, it doesn't have IS,(400 bucks for a Canon 250mm) no, it's not a (L) lens, (1,500 bucks). But for the price and the expandability it offers it was a good purchase. I kills me to see people pay 150 bucks for a lens, then bash it because it isn't a 1,500 dollar lens. We would all love to have one of those. This is a good lens for what it is, a manual focus on distant objects lens. One way to get around the ""hunting"" on auto focus, is to put the camera on spot metering. And if you want even quicker shooting, just flick the camera to auto, let it do the work. This allows the camera to pinpoint the focus on a single spot. It actually stays on the camera 80% of the time, with the lower 75mm rating on zoom, it's just a little closer than the 55mm kit lenses, but with the quick ability to go to 300mm. One of the reasons I chose the Canon was the ability to use older EF lenses thus saving money and expanding as I go.

"My kids are playing with an old toy pair of binoculars. It is missing an eyepiece, it is old and abused for years.  I decided to look for a more decent pair so they can enjoy more their newly found hobby.The first entry after searching online came out to this little guy. It is only around twelve bucks at the time of this review which is just perfect for its purpose.  It also shows hundred of reviews that are positives.It came with a neat black case and a piece of cleaning cloth. Some manufacturers make them with cheapo plastics, this is made of rugged rubberized construction.  It looks like it can withstand some rough handling by my kids.Right in the middle sits a ring for  focusing. My eyes needs prescription glasses, but it provides wide range of focusing that I don't even need my prescription glasses to see clearly on it. Now, that is convenient.  You can also adjust the distance between the two eyepieces easily so it can adapt to both kids and adults.  The only thing missing is a zoom, but I often see that feature only on more expensive and bulkier binoculars.Dont expect a sophisticated lenses at this price. The lenses are basics but capable.  They are also small, making the images dimmer than those with bigger lenses.The only thing I am disappointed is the width of view or coverage.  Most of the time, when you go to a concert or a game, the only thing you will see is the head of the performer.  This is worse when you are not sitting very far because sometimes you want to see the whole body, the whole group, or even part of the stage. Well, I guess it is pretty much the standard.  But it will be great if there are other versions of these binoculars available in other magnification, let's say 4x, or 6 times.  In that case, I will grab another pair right away, specially if they offer them at the same price.",4.0,B00004SABB,1318636800,Good set of eyes
"With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very ""in-style,"" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a ""browsing bookstore"" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft ""bendable plastic"" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more ""coffee house"" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the ""old-fashioned"" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.",4.0,1400532620,1292544000,"Nook BEATS the Kindle Overall, Reading Revived!"

"I owned this camera for about 4 months, and in the time took over 1000 photos with it (yeah, I know, too much free time!). I used the photos for on-screen presentations, as well as 8x10&quot; printouts. The camera takes just incredible photographs, with accurate colors, and very sharp definition. Here are some other points I saw:*autofocus was fairly quick during the day, but can bog down and become very indecisive in low light* flash: powerful, but nothing you do can get rid of red-eye in virtually any shot (red-eye reduction mode is useless)*camera can store photos in separate folders, which is useful for multiple occasions*no support for Microdrive is a fatal flaw*metering system is extremely accurate; found virtually no need to use the spot meter*macro ability is second to none*for dentistry, takes wonderful intraoral photos, utilizing the chair light and the built-in flash; not terribly good, though, if you want to focus on ONE tooth, since the flash will wash things out. The resolution is good enough, though, that you can focus on a quadrant, take the shot, and crop it later.Overall, found it to be the perfect camera, minus the red-eye problems and lack of microdrive support.

"I have owned this camera for over 9 months now and I really like it. The image quality is stunning and I didn't find it all that hard to figure out how to use it. The controls are generally well thought out and positioned  ergonomically.The camera is also slow (I think this is true with most  digital cameras.) You click the shutter and about 1 or 2 secs later it  takes the picture. This may not sound like a big deal, but last night I was  trying to take pictures of my infant son, and in that amount of time he  often moved his face away from the camera.A significant short coming is  the built in flash. Its nowhere near powerful enough, even for a simple  head and shoulders shot when the subject is 4 feet away. Images often come  out too dark. This wouldn't be so bad if there were accomodations for an  external flash, but there doesn't seem to be one. Also, the camera tends to  create &quot;red eye&quot; a lot, which you can correct if you have  PhotoShop, but that's more work than I want to do.The camera does eat up  a lot of power, I agree with the others who suggest getting rechargeable  batteries. You can get a set of NiMH batteries and a charger for about $20  bucks (it takes 4 AA batteries.) I'd suggest getting at least 8 AA  batteries.I do suggest getting extra memory (I have 32 megs) and one of  those USB memory card readers, its a lot faster than a serial port.",4.0,B00000JYWQ,958089600,"Gorgeous images, easy to use, needs better Flash"

"I ordered this camera for the sole purpose of using it in my black/white photo class. And so far i have been able to do everything required with this camera. The lens that comes with the camera is a great starter lens. you have the 35mm setting for to take some pretty good wide angle shots, and u can zoom in any where all the way up to 70mm. its a very versatile lens! some people think this is a ""beginners"" camera and while it is a great camera to learn on, even my photography teacher who has been shooting for over 35 years still owns one of these cameras and loves it. the body is not made out of metal like a lot of earlier nikons, but that doesnt mean this camera wont last you a good 40+ years if treated correctly.but i do however have some concerns.. My first issue was that the lens has a little bit of movement up by the focusing barrel. as in its not 100% tight. im not sure if all lens are like this or if its because this nikkor lens is maybe cheaper quality than other nikon/nikkor lenses. its not really anything big but i decided to exchange it and the next one i got was the same.also for a night photography assignment i had to do, i decided to shoot without a tripod but instead use some 3200iso film. my instructor said that i should be fine with 3200 because its very sensitive to light, hover i found my self only being able to shoot at f3.5 and with a 30/100 shutter speed! and i did set the cameras iso to 3200. dont know if thats normal or not.and finally one thing that was confusing about purchasing this camera on amazon was their very confusing product description that says these camera are ""refurbished"" yet when you look at the sellers and their listings, all of them are listed as new. my camera appeared to be new but i dont think there is a way to tell for sure.",4.0,B00001QHP5,1353196800,This camera does the job
"There are many other reviews that get into the technical aspects of the  Palm IIIxe.  I just wanted to share with you why I bought it and how I use  it.There are many good reviews here.

"Let me first say I really like this keyboard. I have severe tendonitis, and it's a lifesaver. Both the layout of the keys and the key action (softer than normal) contribute to the increased comfort.I am a &quot;keyboard person&quot; (as opposed to being a mouse user), and I use the cursor (arrow) keys a lot. I tried to use the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard, but found its diamond arrangement and smaller-than-normal cursor keys impossible to get used to. This keyboard has the keys in the traditional inverted-T layout. If you EVER use the cursor keys, spend the extra money for this Pro model instead of the Elite!I also really appreciate the Intellitype software that comes with the keyboard. It used to drive me crazy to accidentally hit the Caps Lock key. With the Intellitype software, you can disable the Caps Lock entirely (among many other customizations) -- problem solved!So why didn't I give this product 5 stars? Two reasons: first, the function keys are smaller than normal. I would've preferred them to be full size. Second, the hot keys are dark blue with icons molded into them. The problem is that the icons are not easily visible at a glance. It would've been far better to paint the icons white for high contrast and easy legibility.

"I'm using this to mount an older SyncMaster 191T above my desk and was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy it is for the price.  Installation was simple, though I used the screws from the original monitor mount for the plate attachment, as none of those included would work with my monitor.

"I've owned this changer for about 6 months.  My main fear of buying a large jukebox such as this was whether it would work:  Reviews on Amazon and elsewhere of Sony and JVC carousel changes seemed to indicate that failure rates were high.I was very excited about the CDText feature:  With so many CDs in the changer, an on-screen display of the CD titles without manually entering them seemed like a good feature.  Unfortunately, the changer only seems to support the 'title' field.  I wrote some scripts for Linux to munge the title field to include the artist, but since most of my music is in iTunes (and not on a Linux machine) I eventually quit bothering with CDText altogether (it would be nice if iTunes supported CDText) and just burning the CDs from iTunes.My solution is that I have a print out listing of the CD slot locations.  Not elegant, but it works well.Another concern I had when buying this changer was whether it would work with CD-Rs.  After reading reviews of other brands that claimed the changers were scratching CDs, I knew I was not going to put my original CDs into the changer.I can happily report this changer works fine with CD-Rs.  I've never had a store-bought CD in this changer.I have an optical cable from the changer to my receiver; the sound is wonderful.  Other reviews have mentioned hollow sound from this changer when using the analog connection, and I'm inclined to agree.  Use an optical cable if possible.  Regardless, it sounds as good as my other two 5 disc changers if not better (they are not high end gear, though).Other reviews have complained the changer is slow:  For me, the only place where I feel it is ""slow"" is when detecting that no disc is loaded into a slot.  Actually changing out one disc for another seems rather fast, though of course there is a delay (but it's probably not desirable for the changer to be throwing discs around quickly afterall).  Speed is not really a problem for me with this changer.Construction is solid and the remote is well laid out and compact.  This is my only Pioneer component, but I am very happy with it.",4.0,B00004RDL5,1139097600,"Excellent changer, but wish the CDText support was better"

TIVO is amazing.  I am not much of a TV junkie but TIVO has me hooked.  Like most people I put in a long day at the job.  It is so nice to come home and actually have something I like to watch.

"The Linksys HPN200 uses a newer protocol of a technology that has beenaround since at least 1980 called Data Over Voice, or DOV. Only a coupleof manufacturers made these products, and Black Box might still carry itin their private label version.There never was a bridge to broadband until now. It was and still is away to create a network using twisted-pair wiring between computers toshare files and resources like printers, modems, etc. You can be on thephone and access the modem on another PC connected to a different phoneline, giving you access to your desktop while talking. That was a typicalapplication with 286/386 machines before Windows.For best results, use CAT8 installed in newer houses like mine, or evengo to twisted pair network cable like Belden 88778. You might exceed 1mbper second if you maintain the shielding right to the HPN200 bracket byattaching the drain wire to it with a screw, or screwing the bracket inthe case slot holder with the drain wire. The RJ-11C jack side must havea ground connection for the drain wire on the phone jack.

"I started using Logitech trackballs several years ago and have never been disappointed with them - in fact, I find it hard to use computers that have traditional mice! Recently, my TrackMan Marble gave out, and I replaced it with the TrackMan Marble Wheel. I found it to be a quality product as well.Having used a TrackMan before, my thumb already was conditioned for use, but I still had to adjust the mouse settings in the Control Panel to make sure I could reach all parts of the screen. I have a little difficulty because I'm missing some muscles in my right hand, but I can still use the TrackMan well.  I also appreciated the customizable buttons - the wheel doubles as a third button, which I use as a double-click button. There are many other options available, including the ability to switch the click and right-click buttons if you wish. I was disappointed to see that Logitech didn't make this a four-button mouse; I would have liked to see the three original buttons (from the TrackMan Marble design) remain and have the wheel/button be a fourth button. Also, I found the wheel to be a bit more difficult to use as a button - I tend to scroll as I click from time to time, which causes me to open things I didn't want to open.The wheel is very valuable - I found that I missed it immediately when I went to a computer without one. The wheel makes scrolling much easier in applications, and you can set the scroll amount from the Control Panel as well, although you may have to find a compromise because you can't set the amount separately for separate applications.The quality is excellent. You certainly won't have to clean it as often as traditional mice, although it still needs to be cleaned periodically (or more often, if you're into Diablo-type games). Cleaning is easy - just insert the tip of a pen into the little dot on the mouse, and with a turn, the retaining ring pops out and the ball can be cleaned.You can use this in a USB port or as a PS/2 mouse; however, if you plug it into a USB port, understand that you may have difficulties if you have several USB devices or if you have an intensive device like a Zip drive connected. I've rarely experienced problems, but on occasion, if my Zip drive struggles, it locks up the mouse as well. This is more of a USB issue than a Logitech issue, though, as you can tell from reading the Iomega Zip reviews! Just keep it in mind.I've never felt bad after buying a Logitech mouse, and this was no exception. The only suggestion I'd make to Logitech is to design a left-handed TrackMan Marble. I like to divide my home and work usage equally, especially when a Diablo II or Icewind Dale is released, and you can't get one of these for a lefty. Other than that, I give it high marks and would definitely recommend it.",4.0,B00004L8IG,978307200,"Very nice trackball, but for righties only"

"If you've had a 2 mega-pixel or above camera for more than a few days then you've realized that an 8 or 16 mb memory card is not going to cut it. In my opinion, you really have two good alternatives.

However, the microdrive does cost less per megabyte (in fact, for the same cost you'll get 340 mb of storage vs. 128 mb with the Viking), although you'll have a miniature hard drive to worry about in terms of potential lost photos.I've got both, but I'll only use the microdrive on long trips where I know I'll need the storage space.

"I've been putting off hooking up a router to get my son and wife's PC on the internet because I dreaded having to slog through getting information from my ISP (Verizon), configuring network cards and generally mucking around in places I wasn't comfortable mucking around in.Well, there was absolutely no reason to wait at all.  From plunking the unopened box onto my desk to surfing the internet through the new router took about 10 minutes (and there was a bathroom break included in that time)!  Super easy to setup on my existing PC and absolutely painless on my wife's new PC (running XP all I had to do was plug the network cable in and it did the rest).I must've [made a mistake] ... setting up my DSL originally on my WinME computer, but after installing this router, my internet connection is MUCH faster.

"I have owned my Sony DSC-S70 for many years now. I bought it for just under $600 at the Sony store at Woodbury Commons, NY. It was marked B Stock on the box which indicated it was refurbished. At the time, they were very hard to find and it was regarded as the best available digital camera on the market. Since then, I have tried several different digital cameras but none come close to the accuracy of the color reproduction of the DSC-S70. This can be attributed to the superior optics designed by Carl Zeiss. The movie mode is great too although, your limited to 15 second clips. I have posted some pics here on Amazon. Take a look at the quality of the macro shots. It may not be the fastest or the most portable camera but it does take consistently good pics. It also takes RAW images which you will not find on most point and shoots out there today. In order to get this feature, you would have to step up to a DSLR.  Enough jibber jabber.

"About a year ago, I purchased a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera.  The &quot;wimpy&quot; 8 MB CompactFlash card that came with the unit would only  hold one (1) uncompressed, high-resolution picture - I needed more.  I  started looking and found this; the SanDisk 128 MB CompactFlash.  I read on  the Nikon technical support web page that SanDisk is the OEM for Nikon's  CompactFlash cards, so I felt pretty safe selecting this card.  The only  question I had was &quot;would my Coolpix 950 work with a card this  large?&quot;  The answer is a resounding YES!  (according to friends, it  will work in the new Coolpix 990 also)The card formatted in the camera  perfectly and has simply worked for the past nine months.  I shoot all  pictures in high resolution with a moderate compression level, allowing me  to store more than 110 - 2.1 MegaPixel pictures in the camera - plenty for  me.  Recently, we took a five-day trip to Disney World - this card captured  ALL of our pictures perfectly.  If you get this, check out one of the USB  card readers as well - the serial connection is just way too slow for  transferring this much data.Executive Summary:  Buy it now.",5.0,B0000488VI,969408000,Outstanding Product - Essential for Nikon Coolpix
"I am a rookie picture-taker.  I never really had a use for a camera with a zoom lens.  I was always content to use my VERY simple point and shoot.  One day, my pictures came out so badly from my simple camera that I decided that I need to get one with a zoom lens.  I looked at many brands of cameras, but I never considered the Olympus.  Then one of my friends, who knows a lot more than I do about cameras, convinced me to test the Olympus Stylus Epic.  I fell instantly in love, and I bought it.  That choice has been the best decision I ever made!  I love the small size and sleek design of this camera.  I also LOVE all the bells and whistles on it, especially the timer because no one gets left out of the picture.  It also takes very good photographs.

"This 35mm is pretty much the perfect college kid film camera.  It wont spoon feed you when it comes to learning, which will really help you in the long run.  In the age of ""press this button and you're focused"", this camera is one of the few 35mm's left that doesn't have AF.  Also wont change exposure levels to what the camera suggests(such as AV or TV mode some cameras have), this gives you the freedom to be creative as some shots have a whole different mood if underexposed a stop or overexposed a bit.  As for manual focus, it's something you need to be able to do as a photographer.  Sometimes the computer in your camera just doesn't focus perfectly on that eye you want in focus, or for something as precise as macro photography which has very shallow depth you're going to need pinpoint accuracy that a computer can not do for you.This lens is great because it's like the vintage 35mm except you don't have to worry about the light meter or any other small part inside of it being broken.  Nor do you have to worry about the image quality.  The kit lens in this camera is very sharp.  It's a bit limiting considering it's f/3.5 so that rules out really low light(but grain can be good, unlike noise in digital; grain has an artistic quality), but considering the price and the quality of the whole kit it's great.Sure you can get a used one from the 70's or 80's for way cheaper, but chances are something is broken in that thing and you may not know until you've invested 2 hours developing the first roll in your class...So shell out a little bit extra and get this, it's worth it.edit 12-9-10:I still like this, shot some street photography with it since it's really compact compared to a big DSLR, but one big con I've found is build quality. It's got a lot of plastic, and I did drop it once which resulted in a huge dent. The silver parts look metal but they aren't, they're some sort of chrome paint covering more plastic. I don't baby my gear so this thing's starting to look kinda ugly.  It hasn't completely broken yet though.  I said the kit lens was sharp in my review, but really I now know it's not as good as I made it out to be, I recommend a used nikon e series 50mm 1.8 ais which can be had for cheap on the used market.",5.0,B00001QHP5,1261958400,Great fully manual 35mm
"Been using this stuff for a couple years.  Works great for me. I use it different than the instruction.  Find a flat surface, lay a bundle of tissue on it, place the disk scratched face up.  Place a couple drops of #1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward (you don't have to wait 5 minutes).  Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry (about 5 minutes).  Spray once with #2, and using a clean TISSUE, continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until #2 dries.  Try the disk.  If it doesn't work, repeat all the above until it does.  This really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches.

"I bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews I'd read on the internet. I wanted something with decent sound and comfort that wouldn't break the bank; I will be traveling abroad for a semester, and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm not much of an audiophile, but I was very pleased with the PortaPros. They are very comfortable, provide ample bass and overall sound quality, and fold up to make them quite portable to boot (go figure). The included case and 1/4"" audio adapter were nice bonuses. I am using them with an iPod and my laptop, both sound even better than my stereo with the PortaPros. Only thing I dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in ""travel mode"" doesn't hold all that well.If you buy them, consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with (Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions).

"This camera cannot be appreciated based on its specifications alone. The intangible qualities are what make this camera an excellent choice for anyone simply wanting great quality pictures from a camera that operates like a film camera, but has all the advantages of a digital camera.- The pictures are excellent (especially the color), although low-light pictures are a little grainier than I would like.- The flash is VERY powerful considering the camera's small size.- Stainless steel body seems very durable, feels solid in your hand- Camera operates very fast: turning on/off, menu navigation, shutter/autofocus delay, flash recharge, switching modes. In my opinion, this is one of the most important features of any digital camera, and most don't have it!- Battery life is excellent! Only 2 AA's easily last for a day of normal use. I usually get at least 2 days out of them.

"I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes:I used to have a Kindle 3. It was great. It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change. I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like. Well I decided to buy the Nook and I'm very, very pleased. I won't go into an in depth review of the device itself. You can find that just about anywhere. What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier. I love the on screen virtual keyboard (like the ipad) and the fact that it's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books......or does it??With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch (voids your warranty). Now when I turn on the Nook, it gives me a dual boot screen (sort of). I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen. Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app. I ran that app, logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch. The only thing missing is text to speech but I didn't use that feature anyway.

The drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple, ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the ears.The sound is superb, especially considering the size of the phones. The bass extension is very good and satisfying, much better than comparably sized phones. The overall sound is neutral and non-fatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired.One thing to note is that headphones typically are ""open"" or ""closed"" design. A closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments. Open headphones, like the Koss PortaPros, are designed for use in quiet environments. So if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane, these are not designed for that type of use.Another very important feature of Koss phones is the lifetime warranty. I have had my Koss PortaPros for over 10 years now. I have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out. I sent them back to Koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge(see their website for details), and they promptly refurbished my headphones, and even put on new pads to replace my old pads! Other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones. So if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use, the lifetime warranty is a big plus.Those interested in small, open style phones may also want to check out the Sennheiser PX100, which delivers similar performance, though the PX100 has less prominent bass and more mid-range; the typical Sennheiser sound. Both are excellent values but in my mind, the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the Koss phones a slightly better deal.",5.0,B00001P4ZH,1128384000,Excellent headphones for portable electronics

"I was expecting to buy a cleaning system that has at least a liquid solution, and of course those fancy ones with a machine that rotates the discs!

"Very happy with the purchase of the nook.  Wonderful minimalist design lends well to an e-reader - It's easy to hold and is the perfect size for those used to the size of a paperback (slightly larger, yes, but certainly not as large as the Kindle or the Ipad).  I'm tired of these negative reviews about devices that are defective - Yes, we all get electronics that go bad, but really, can't you talk about the functionality of the device a bit?  Anyway, the device isn't perfect (interface not as smooth as the Ipad), but for the price and functionality it's great.  I can read e-books borrowed from my local library, have free 3G service when I'm out and about, and I like the fact that the reading screen is not touch based (avoids fingerprints).

"Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the ""best value in a mid-size Android tablet"" category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.  A 5 star item for features, design, performance, and value.",5.0,1400699169,1372204800,"5 star item for features, design, performance, and value."
"To begin, the sound on these is very detailed, and it will play your music like it is. If your music is a poorly recorded track, it will sound poorly recorded so I recommend feeding these ""studio monitor headphones"" the highest quality sound files you can. The bass can extend deep and low yet remain tight (not flabby), the mids are well balanced and have no artificial coloration to them, and the highs are all there. I auditioned these at a store before I bought them, and preferred them to the Audio Technica M-50's, Grado SR60's, Sennheiser 280's, and even some amped Sennheiser HD650's. And these Sony V6's don't need amping at all because can be easily driven by an ipod and get get really loud.I don't think these have a perfectly flat response, they are a little bass and treble heavy to my ears. I believe everyone's ears are different, and for me, I agree with the reviewers that say the treble can be harsh. And because of this, I could not crank the volume without the treble eventually becoming fatiguing. But since I still loved the sound and clarity of these, I tried to see if I could change this. I went to the craft store and bought some thin felt for a few cents, cut it to proper size and then placed it between the headphone drivers(speakers)and the ear pads. This cut down the harshness without changing anything else, and now I decided I will be keeping these.Another modification I had to do relates to my ears. My ears are big and poke out, and these headphones were very uncomfortable because they pushed on my ears to much, since they do have some clamping force for sound isolation. I found another simple solution for this: you cut some thin strips of cloth from a t-shirt and push them in the crevice under the pad that goes around your ears to give more space between your ear and the drivers, thus making them rest around your ears up against your head, and not ON your ears. You don't want to shove too much material in there or you start to lose some bass and could maybe tear the ear pads if you get too crazy. Just a half of an inch width by six inches long folded in half ""hot dog style"" worked great for me. I found I didn't need to upgrade to the Beyerdynamic pads after doing this, and now these are comfortable for hours and this saved me twenty four dollars. Since the headband has a metal spine through it, I was also successful in carefully bending it outward to provide less clamping force on my larger than normal head.The sound isolation on these is great, and I actually love the coiled cord which helps from keeping the cord ripped out of the headphone if it gets snagged on something. They are built very well, but I do not like the small wires exposed on the sides which I think makes them vulnerable to snag so I will have to be careful. I think these headphones are as good as you can get for $70, if you want better you are going to have to start spending a lot more money. Just make sure you buy from a refutable seller and make sure you don't buy fakes, which are out there in abundance. These headphones are great so I wrote this review- to let you know there potential and to show you how you can improve them with simple, non permanent mods if you are inclined to try them. I hope Sony never stops making these.",5.0,B00001WRSJ,1371081600,"My favorite headphones, after a few small modifications"

"Had one since Christmas 2010 and already owned a regular Nook, so I am familiar with the differences between the displays.  The NC is a fabulous, if a bit heavy, device that is a great ebook reader as well as video player out of the box.

Adjusting the brightness and contrast is easy enough and I've read for hours with no eye strain.  I'm more than satisfied with it because unlike the Kindle, I can read almost anything (and rooted even Kindle books using the android Kindle app).

"I bought this switch when my home network started to grow and was not able to accommodate all the new devices that I was adding to it.

A full additional router for that purpose would be unnecessary and much of an overkill, and this switch seemed like a perfect solution.

"Looking for portable headphones, I first went with theSennheiser  PX 100 Lightweight Collapsible Headphones, because I've been using Sennheisers for years (the HD 580s for about 12 years before they finally died, and theSennheiser  CX300-B In-Ear  Stereo Headphone (Old Version)for the couple of years they lasted), and figured I'd try their portable headphones.  As I wrote in my review of the PX-100s (http://www.amazon.com/review/R20I6FUMDQJ2RW/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm), I found them uncomfortable, and lacking in bass.  These PortaPros fix both those problems: I can wear them for many hours consecutively before my ear cartilage gets a bit sore, but this is a big improvement over the Sennheiser PX 100s, which started hurting after only about an hour.  Bass is good enough, though perhaps lacking slightly compared to high-end headphones.  But, for $40 these offer a great bang-for-buck in sound quality.The only negatives are the retro look (if that bothers you - I don't mind it at all), and if you have long hair (I don't), the metal band tends to catch your hair and pull out a few strands; I know when this starts happening to me, it's time for a haircut :)",5.0,B00001P4ZH,1350604800,Better than the Sennheiser PX 100

"I first tried these headphones in the base exchange while I was stationed in Germany during my tour in the service.  I compared them to a dozen brands they had, including full ear ""professional"" sets like AKG and Sennheiser. As mentioned previously, these have the most incredibly tight and full bass. The tweeters put out crisp, clear highs -- especially brass. I bought them on the spot and wore them daily until one day I accidentally pulled the wire out of the phones. I sent it back to the factory with $5.00 shipping and had them back, good as new in less than 2 weeks. The earphone mounting design, while comfortable, is not very sturdy. The earpieces snap into the headset and have a central pivot point which is made of plastic of course.  Well, I broke that piece and the earpiece would not stay on the headset so I sent them to the factory with $5.00 and they fixed them again and shipped them back quickly, good as new.

"Cannot beat this deal anywhere else on the web!  All other retailers are over-priced for what you are getting - a couple pieces of fabricated metal to hold a TV that articulates! This mount is reasonably priced.Pros:  Easy to install (helps to have a cordless driver to drill 6 pilot holes, and to drive in 6 lag screws. You also need to have a stud finder).- Well fabricated- Mount does everything advertised (i.e. articulates - you made need to loosen up some nuts)Con's: Really stretching here since this is a good deal: Instructions could use some help for the ""novice"" DIY'ersInstall tip:  It really helps if you have a second person assisting you for the final step of mounting the flat panel to the TV mountInstalled a 15.5 lbs, 26 Inch Flat Panel LCD (VESA 200mm X 100mm) to this mount. Mount works beautifully! I originally had the TV sitting a little high on a stand, but then the picture was not as good because of the upward viewing angle of the screen (inherent problem with cheaper LCD's - not being directly in front of a LCD screen) - this mount corrected this issue by allowing me to ""tilt down"" the screen.

"Just picked up a refurbished Nook Tablet from newegg's website and its amazing. Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion. Matter of fact I am writing this review on my iPad and shortly I will go back to reading on my Nook Tablet.",5.0,1400501466,1362268800,Best ebook reader under $150!

"I just bought my second pack of these wipes. I bought the first pack late last year and am finally running out of them. I was totally surprised that these wipes work so well. I have had DVD's that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface. Taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge (across the grooves) seems to get the job done. Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch. I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside.

"I've been using these since they first came out. I was a recording engineer at the time and a friend who was a boom man on movies turned me on to them. I have tried many other headphones over the years, but these have always been and continue to be the gold standard. Some may not find them as comfortable as other brands, but they get better over time and the sound quality is definitely worth the investment. When these first came out, they were put in Sony's consumer line but as does happen in audio, the pros got turned on to them and before long, they were outselling the headphones in Sony's pro line (who complained loudly :-o). Sony then introduced the 7506 into the pro line and charged more money for them ;-). I remember for a while it was hard to find the V6s. But apparently, so many professionals complained that eventually, Sony made the V6s available again. I don't use these to listen to my iPod for several reasons... number one, they are highly accurate. While that SOUNDS good, what it really means they are very flat in their response... no presence boost, no bass boost... zip, nada! That may make them seem ""dull"" when compared to other headphones but in essence, for a professional who is trying to capture audio accurately, it is a blessing. The second reason is, they are too big to fit in a pocket with your iPod. When done listening, I wrap my etymotics around my iPod and shove the whole thing in my coat pocket, no worries. Even if you fold these guys up, you'll have a tough time getting them in all but the largest pockets. One final thing I can add that has nothing to do with the use of the headphones per se, is the bag that comes with these is a POS. I learned early on that they rip, flake, and basically fall apart. When my first one disintegrated, that same movie sound man turned me onto the perfect replacement.... a Crown Royal bag. The headphones fit perfectly and 15 years later, I'm still using the same bag. Leave it to the liquor folks to outdo the audio manufacturers when it comes to quality packaging. :-D Enjoy... as I said, I have for over two decades now.

"I have tendonitis in my wrist so finding something that was comfortable  and unobtrusive was essential. This keyboard fit the bill perfectly. I now  use this keyboard both at home and at work. It's a tired analogy, but it  rings true here: using this keyboard is like trying on that pair of jeans  that fit you just right. You won't want to go back to anything less.Everyone asks the same question: isn't this keyboard hard to get used  to? I too thought it would take weeks, but I was comfortable with it after  two days (~8 hrs/day). I find the built-in wrist rest to be quite good and  the row of multi-media keys are a nice bonus feature (great to be able to  mute your music or adjust the volume with a quick keypress, especially if  you use headphones).No regrets, but there are two downsides you should  be aware of: 1) you may become more sensitive to non-ergonomic keyboards (I  get aches after using any cramped laptop keyboard now; normal keyboards are  still ok, just less comfortable) , and 2) the re-arrangement of the  function keys makes them a bit of a chore to get used to.",5.0,B00002JXFH,967939200,A compulsory computer component

"As I write this review from work I wish I were using Microsoft's Natural Keyboard Pro.  I bought two last year and gave one to my aunt; if it were possible to fall in love with a keyboard, then this thing would steal my  heart.The Natural Keyboard Pro is the true successor to the original  Natural Keyboard; forget about the Keyboard Elite.  This board sports 19  multimedia &quot;hot keys&quot; that launch browsers, refresh web pages,  and much more.  There are connectors for USB and PS/2 ports; Microsoft  recommends plugging the keyboard into both ports although you can use  whatever port you want.Key response is good without feeling mushy and  the built-in wrist rest is good for those users who like to relax theirs  wrists at the bottom of the keyboard.  The IntelliType software that ships  with the keyboard is version 1.0; users of America Online will want to  download the patch for compatibility with AOL's 5.0 software.I like  Microsoft's latest keyboard.  It's a good, sturdy keyboard with cool  features that are really useful.

"I must admit that I like having new electronic toys when they come out.  I purchased a digital camera in 1997 and was not entirely impressed by what 500$ got me then.  However, 3 years later, I stumbled upon the Nikon  Coolpix 800 at a great price and took another shot at digital  imaging.PICTURES: The pictures it takes are fantastic!  The 1600x1200  resolution really makes a difference when making prints.  They look like  they were taken with a 35mm.  This is not even mentioning the backing of a  quality Nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same  resolution do not.  Another feature that impressed me was the fact I could  add additional lenses to it (and Nikon has 3 designed specifically for the  Coolpix 800/950/990).FEATURES: It has a lot of features of its bigger  brother like an uncompressed TIFF format, ability to take B&amp;W pictures,  and adjustable metering.  However, for a non-professional photographer, I  liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great  pictures right away.  I now can switch to manual mode to take more control  of the picture, but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of  the box.  Unlike other reviewers, mine came with a paper manual in addition  to a CD-ROM that explained many of the basic features and taught me about  some of the more exotic ones.This is a great camera for anyone wanting a  digital camera that takes great pictures but doesn't want to spend ton of  money on features that may not even be used.  Otherwise, the CP990 and the  D1 are really nice cameras for those interested in more control.  I do  recommend getting an extra Flash card since 8 MB does run out fairly  quickly when taking pictures in FINE or NORMAL mode.  Getting a USB SanDisk  CompactFlash reader was also a big help since the built-in connection is  serial and can take a LONG time to download pictures if you have a lot of  them.",5.0,B0000365CI,955756800,A great amateur digital camera!

"I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful.

"I purchased this radio from Amazon in May of 2003. It's now January 2005 and the radio is still on the first set of batteries. I use it at least a 1/2 hour a day and on weekends as much as 3-4 hours per day. Fantastic. It shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower, and has even been in light rain beside our spa.It gets great reception (no TV signals in our town), is easy to use, and sounds great.I highly recommend this radio.UPDATE Oct 28, 2010After 7 1/2 years of daily use my Sony shower radio finally quit. As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked, water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work. However I just ordered another one.This radio has some very good qualities.Pros:1) Clear and loud sound2) Battery life is so long it is ridiculous. I don't think I used more than three sets of batteries in 7 years, and I use the radio every day.3) Good reception.4) Ease of use. I really appreciate an AM/FM radio with station presets.5) It is waterproof enough that I take it in the shower every day. I don't leave it there though because I use it on the bathroom counter while I shave too. Perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isn't in the damp shower area 24/7.6) I like the top buttons. They are easy to hit with one hand. If the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands. My radio is never mounted high so I don't have the issue others complain about where they can't see the buttons. Even if I did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump.Cons:1) $49 is a very high price to pay for an AM/FM radio.2) It does seem Sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer.I was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale.

"I've owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far. I agree with the other customers about the manual... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language, not three languages together in one  page. But the camera is very easy to use, takes excellent pictures and has  many nice features. With a tripod, you can take great pictures at night  without the flash! The software is also very easy to use. Although it's not  documented in the manual, the camera comes with a TWAIN driver, so you can  choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your  favorite photo editing software.",5.0,B00000JFIF,941673600,"Excellent product, good value"

"I bought these babies at a FYE when I was just shopping around. I have read that they have amazing sound and you can't find a better sound for the money. Man were the reviewers right! The sound-stage is amazing, with great highs and bass. The bass is delivered so well, I can't find words other than impressive and intense, especially for the size of these headphones. I must say, they get better sound than headphones that range up to $120 and even more easily. I listen to a lot of 60's to 80's rock and all types of heavy metal and the sound is delivered powerfully. A 3D type of Sound. Also try the Koss KSC-75's for an even better performance.Pro's1) Price is unbeatable2) Great balance of high's, mid's and low's3) Ground breaking bass4) Great Sound-stage (Separation of instruments)5) A 3D sound6) Cool 80's design7) Sound doesn't need to be amplified (It shouldn't be either)Con's1) Gets slightly uncomfortable to wear after a while (1 hour or so)2) Seems flimsy at times3) Although it seems to be made of good material, the case/bag that comes with headphones is too small and a pain to get headphones in and out of.",5.0,B00001P4ZH,1357430400,Be$t Headphone$ for the $$$$$!

"When my Palm V was stolen last May, I went right out and bought a Palm Vx to replace it!  Upfront, I should address the comment of the reviewer below who complained of losing his data when the device crashed.  The Palm Vx comes with software that allows you to create a copy of all your Palm data on your computer.  If you lose the Palm data for some reason (or the computer data), you can restore the lost data with a couple of mouse clicks. The Palm comes with a &quot;cradle&quot; that is used for recharging and for linking to the computer.  When my Palm was stolen, I easily restored my information into my new Palm Vx.  The process of storing data takes about 15 seconds, and literally just takes a button push after you have put your Palm in the cradle. I should mention that in 18 months of extensive use, I've never &quot;lost&quot; my data due to software failure.  I did lose it when my Palm was stolen of course, but was  easily able to replace it. I find two main uses for my Palm--As a scheduler, I can enter something I want to be reminded of at a future date, and have the Palm alert me at a specified time (typically five minutes before the meeting starts, for meetings at my work).  You can easily view all the items in place for each day, and there is also a weekly view.  This can be done years in advance, and doesn't have to be for work stuff--I have a gasket in an underwater camera which needs to be replaced in May, 2002, and I have entered a reminder to alert me at that time! The other thing I use it for is as a way to find &quot;forgotten&quot; information.  I make and store memos of important conversation or important information.  Also, I make notes in the &quot;address book&quot; of key information about people--Things I've discussed with them, or areas of expertise they have.  I can use the &quot;find&quot; feature on my Palm to locate a term.  So if I want to know what conversations I've had about widgets, or who I have talked to that knows about widgets, I can enter &quot;widget&quot; in the find feature, and I will be shown a list of all my memos that mention widgets in the text, and anyone in my address book who I listed as being widget-related!  Incidentally, I'll also get a list of any appointments in my calendar that mention widgets. If you are a busy person (and not just a business type, students, or homemakers may benefit as well) I believe you will be able to make good use of a Palm Vx.  You may be equally satisfied with a Handspring, or with other makes of Palm, though.  The two great advantages I see with the Palm Vx (or Palm V, if you can still find one) are that the profile of the device is very slender--It fits in my front slacks pocket without leaving a substantial bulge.  Second advantage is that the internal battery provides power for a week to two weeks of use, and can be recharged by resting in the cradle. No need to buy replacement batteries, or juggle them around replacing them.",5.0,B000031KIM,976752000,I love mine....
"My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images. The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it. The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it. But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.The larger the CompactFlash card that you use, the slower  it takes for the ELPH to turn on. It takes about 2-3 seconds of pressing  the on button plus 2 more seconds till you can shoot a picture. I  understand this is to prevent automatic turn-ons but sometimes I want to  immediately take a picture.That aside, this is a great camera. I bought  a 32mb CompactFlash to go with it and shoot in Fine mode (1600x1200  compressed) and get about 50-60 images. It takes about 4 seconds to  transfer each picture via USB to my Apple G3 PowerBook.The QTVR  (panorama) generating software is great. It eliminates much of the hard  work for the user. But you really need to keep it on a stable surface to do  this well.I also have an ELPH Jr. APS camera. (With a black body before  Canon changed it.) It got it because it was so portable (i.e. usable). This  is every bit as enjoyable. I rarely ever use the flash. The zoom works  perfectly fine, though I'm not much of a zoom user. My friend has an S10  and his pictures are a little better, but the S100 wins out for its  tremendous portability.",5.0,B00004TS16,962668800,"Small, delightful and well-designed"
"I love these headphones; they've got superb sound (particularly the bass region--I didn't know headphones were capable of this kind of bass!), they're very portable, inexpensive, and the accessories &amp; features it comes with are great.  They're also very comfortable (particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behind/above your ears), although I have a small head and I've heard that these phones don't fit so well on bigger heads.  I also like the way they look, and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonus.",5.0,B00001P505,972691200,Great headphones!
"I haven't really given up my Kindle (which I love and has its advantages). However, I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump. If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen. So now we fight over it. Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way. But I find the Nook Color becoming more my at home reader with the Kindle app on it, and my Kindle device turning into an away from home, travel e-reader.",5.0,1400532655,1303344000,Moved Over to the Dark Side From Kindle
"I want to like these headphones.  I bought a pair of SportaPros and wanted a second pair, tried the PortaPros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews.  Now I am wondering - what are people listening to?  The SportaPros sound so much better than the PortaPros that I have to believe something is wrong.  No depth or layering or punchiness to the PortaPros.  Portas are mostly defined by over-response in the treble range.  I'm getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channel.I've heard all about the ""burn-in"" for headphones, but the Sporta's haven't needed that and I'm not sure how much time to waste on these Porta's.  I also own a pair of Sennheiser HD238 which beat the heck out of the PortaPros but are somewhat on a par with the SportaPros.  Now the Senns seem to be sounding better with more use as I did not like them as well out of the box, but do now.  Or my ears are getting ""burnt-in"" to their sound as I think happens also.Is there something wrong with my PortaPros?  I have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones I have.** Update 1/28/11 - another thing with these phones - the channels are reversed!  Listening to ""All I've Gotta Do"" by the Beatles (old stereo, music one side vocals the other) I have 3 sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel.  On these, it is reversed (and yes I do know how to put them on, triple checked etc).  WTH is the deal with these?** Another update - A1 Accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though I've already lost all my original packaging and stuff.  So many thanks to them for so far great customer service.  I'll post on the new ones when they arrive.** Update 1/31/11.  Quick service from A1 Accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better.  Now I can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable (and channels are no longer switched).  I am finding that the Firm - Light settings are very touchy.  They don't want to stay on the ""Light"" setting easily but that is a minor problem.  I am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect this.",5.0,B00001P4ZH,1295481600,Did I get a bad pair??  Apparently so...
"I have been a dayrunner junkie for years.  The problem is I stopped carrying it everywhere (especially afterhours) because it just got so big.  I got the Palm Vx a few months ago and it has completely replaced my  dayrunner.  It totally syncs with my outlook so I have the one schedule at  the office and on the Palm.  I have more than 300 contacts with phone,  email, addresses and notes. I have the last 30 days worth of email  messages.  I have the latest fodor's guide for my home city and the ability  to download any city I am visiting.  I have the a daily listing of the  current movies, which theaters are showing, and the times.  I have hearts  (a favorite card game - with jack of diamonds is worth -10).  I can take  short notes and make reminders. It beeps to let me know when the next  appointment is going to happen (let's see a dayrunner do that!).  And I  have barely scratched the surface of what this thing can do.

"Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience. I now prefer it to reading books in print, to be perfectly honest.",5.0,1400599997,1272585600,Easy on the Eyes

All it has is one optical jack and one set of L/R RCA jacks for a stereo VCR source.So all I did was go to Wal Mart or Radio Shack (can't remember which) and bought the only optical cable they had for like 20 bucks.
