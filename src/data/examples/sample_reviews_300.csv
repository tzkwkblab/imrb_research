"I attached the antenna to the rear window on my Jeep Wrangler, and hooked it up to a Cobra radio.  Reception was poor at anything over 30 yards. Transmission was nil. I don't know if the factory window tint had anything to do with the poor performance, but there was nothing in the instructions to indicate that.

"Really though? Maybe its because i've listened to much better before. If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day.

"No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",1.0,1400532736,1378252800,Barnes and Noble Customer Service?

"I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.Note: I put this review on the B&N; site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms.

"Let me get right to the point.  When this DVD player was working, it worked well.  Good picture quality, reliable service, reasonable remote.  WHEN it worked...Unfortunately, this particular generation of Sony products falls victim to Sony's perplexing high failure rate and infant mortality problems.  After only six months of very moderate use, suddenly the unit refused to play newer DVDs (instead, displaying an &quot;Insert Disc&quot; message).  Soon thereafter, we got the dreaded &quot;C:13&quot; error on the screen and front panel of the player, indicating that the unit had essentially failed.  Now, I can play a few older, single-layer DVDs, but not newer dual-layer DVDs.  In researching the C:13 error via Google, it appears that Sony refuses to recognize the MASSIVE number of people experiencing this problem.  Now, it appears that some class-action lawsuits may be headed Sony's way from some very upset customers.  I am certainly one of them.So, caveat emptor.  Sony certainly is an innovative company, but their quality control and longevity engineering is woeful as evidenced by the huge number of failures experienced by this product.

I've never had a router fail like this before (and I have 5 in my current home network in various places all over the house).I was using the original transformer that came with it and measured the voltage - it was pumping out 10.6v under no load and 9.5v when connected to the Linksys.

I can't notice any difference in my picture quality. I figure it can't hurt and can only help.I do like the ergonomic features.  Certainly color coding and labeling of which plug is for what piece of equipment is great! No more searching for the right plug.

"I purchased these headphones before traveling to Europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great.  The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice.  The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains.  I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable.  They are made of plastic and feel very fragile.  I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch.  But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design.  After only about a month, one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely.  And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again.

"I own the original Nook e-ink reader and the Nook tablet.  I have been happy with both.  When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldn't wait to buy one.  The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.

"Based on people's descriptions, I would guess that about half of these reviews were meant for the MDR-V6. The MDR-V6 is the one that is comparable to the mdr-7506, NOT the v600. If you are not familiar with the MDR line, I can understand how easy it is to confuse the model numbers. I own the V6 and my brother owns the MDR-7506 and i have directly compared these and found that are identical physically from what I can tell aesthetically and both have near identical sound. The MDR-V600 can be described as the black sheep in the family, since it looks, feels, and sounds very different than its more accomplished siblings.The MDR-v600 is much bigger and bulkier than both the V6 and the mdr-7502. While it uses similar drivers, It has a huge earcup and large foam paddings that color the sound. Most noticeable is overbearing amount of bass this thing gives out, which drowns out the mids. This would account for some of muddiness that other reviewers have described. So how this headphone got to be called studio monitors is beyond me. This headphone is more like a pair of v6 that was modified to meet the mainstream demands of bassheads. Whereas v6 was half metal/half plastic, the v600 is all plastic. On the plus side, the huge earcups do help isolate sound a little better than the V6/7502.If you want accurate sound that you can actually use as monitors, stick with the tried and true Sony models such as the v6 or 7502.

"I gave these a 3 star rating but only because of the low price, otherwise a 1 or 2.Pros:Lightweight (but what headphones in this class aren't?)Cheap ( but what &#34; ... )Top band and slider rails appear to be made of HDPE plastic which is more flexible, won't become as brittle over time to reduce # of areas likely to break, and yet the top band would be even more durable made of spring metal and then it could hold an adjustment for optimal tension to suit your head sizeFair amount of bass for the cup size and price, not especially boomy, not out of control bass trying to make up for the shortcomings of a small driver and thin/light low volume plastic cupsFair cord length for portable use, ought to be 1' shorter for that but the extra 1' might help if your source is in a bag rather than a pocket nearer your head.90' plug doesn't stick up as far on portable players so they seem less bulky and there's less stress to the headphone jackFairly conservative design, no silly colors or shapes for niche artistic styling that not everyone would like, rather than the purpose of headphones.  They don't look &#34;as&#34; cheap as some in the same price class.Foam cushions are a little higher density than some, letting them sit closer to your ears.You won't care much if you break them or if they are stolen, except then you have no cans till you find a replacement.Cons:Lightweight - They have that empty tin can sound accentuating upper midrange, and they could have put a bit more plastic into the pieces that hold the cups only the adjustment sliders for more durabilityNo strain relief on the wires where they exit the cups.  If you coil your cord up for storage during portable use, you will find this to be one of the early failure modes.Clunky size adjustment, the notches in the HDPE rails are large and HDPE doesn't mold into distinct notches as well as other plasticsPre-molded angle on cups seems a little large compared to many cans, if your ears don't stick out a lot you may find they don't sit as flush against your ears as many cans despite the slight amount of swivel present, which results in loss of hearing much of the lower midrange and bassWhile the bass is fairly controlled for this price,  their marketing dept. fails with the feature &#34;XBS port&#34; because the bass is fairly poor relative to almost any (even slightly) larger cupped cans.  Small, light and portable is good but if you can accept an ounce of weight and a few millimeters size increase there are huge bass improvements to be had on cans with only slightly larger cups, and yet the price on those goes up some too.Although they are inexpensive, it would only cost a few cents more to make them more durable and improve the sound quality.  This seems like a false economy to me, my body and gear weigh dozens of pounds so why is shaving fractions of an ounce off their weight so important?  It isn't, this is just about saving a few cents in manufacturing cost at the expense of the aforementioned details.Overall:It's tempting to pick a product based on the lower price, but often you only get what you pay for.  Yes you could pay the same for inferior cans but don't let some of the more positive reviews fool you, these don't sound good at all relative to cans costly only a few dollar more.  They sound only slightly better than any $2 generic cans you can find anywhere.Despite all the pros I listed, they just don't meet the core purpose of providing good audio.  It is distracting how terrible they sound.  To be fair I would write the same about any $5 cans I've ever heard but on most I didn't see so many positive reviews that misled me into hoping these were different when they aren't.For a reference point, many consider me an audiophile.  My standards seem to be higher than average, but I'm not an elite snob about certain makes and models.  I've owned many a pair of cans and build some of my own audio gear and modify the rest.  Even so I am not trying to compare these against $40 cans, let alone more costly pairs.  They just don't sound good enough to use even if they were free, unless you're only listening to audible books or similar voice.  I would have returned them except that they are so inexpensive that it wasn't worth the bother.",3.0,B00004T8R2,1361232000,Only Because Of The Price
"I wish I had a better rating. I guess it is a little unfair. The headphones themselves are amazing! The bass is really good with songs. BUT, unlike someone else's comment (which swayed my decision to purchase a little), it is not a good size for even kids. I have a really small head and these do not fit me. Plus, I have TMJ and somehow, it squeezes my jaw and it hurts after a few minutes. Ouch. So be aware when buying these that you are sure about the size. They extend quite a bit. So, I think the issue is having a really small head. Although, I am not sure about the other extreme (having a really big head). Ha. I guess the same issue would arise. I have no idea. I wish my head were bigger and my jaw was not so messed up... These are really great headphones otherwise. But, from my experience alone, I have to give a lower rating... Booo.

"I have not used a GPS unit before, but purchaed this based on reviews.  With nothing to compare it to, I can report the following:  Although the instructions are straight forward, I found that the buttons are not so easy to navigate.  I make many mistakes in programing and have to start over.  I also found the this is not very accurate.  At 500 feet, the GPS unit will show any direction.  I have to get to within 250 feet of a way point to start getting any type of accuracy.  If I did not know the direction of the way point at 400-500 feet I literally have to walk in circles and watch the unit point me false directions.  Again at 250 feet it is accurate.I have used this in the UP of Michigan and it takes about 5 minutes to get the satellites up and running. Also, if you want to save the information on your computer you will need to buy the cords, about $20.00, once I purchased these I then found I would have to purchase the software, it was not free at Garmin, so that would be another $20.00. I returned the cords and did not get the software.  So if you want to save your information plan on spending another $40.00.For my first GPS I think it is okay.

"Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",4.0,0972683275,1363305600,"Well made, Excellent Value"

There has been some talk that Sony may discontinue the 7506...sure hope that doesn't happen.BTW, the consumer MDR-v600 is NOT the same thing as the pro-line MDR-7506.

"I think that this works very well... but it can be a bit picky to connect to your visor... its not really hard but lining up the unit and the keyboard requires some maneuvering sometimes... and i can see how you could just *knock* off the connecting pins...  i used it a few times on my lap instead of a desk and it doesnt seem to to lie stragt now, even on a desk.  i am not sure if its cause i used it on a not flat surface or after time it just doesnt *connect* as effecently and isnt as flat...but it is a bit of a pain..  also i had a time when i had to call the support line (who were very helpful by the way)  it seems that it works best if you connect the unit when the visor is off and than turn it on...so the drivers load.Sometimes the drivers will not load if you connect the keyboard to a visor that is *on*...  it seems if the visor is on and you connect sometimes the keyboard wont work and you wont know why... this seems a bit picky and a reel pain in a meeting.ON THE OTHER HAND.... it is way easier than using graffiti..or the on screen keyboard... it makes the visor MUCH more useful for taking notes, putting in data...addresses..etc  There are many more keyboards on the market now than when i bought mine and i would check them all out...but besides these few things mine has been working well for as long as they have been out",4.0,B00004TL5Q,1023408000,Very good overall...few *techy* issues with it

"The Rio is overall a great product. The buttons and &quot;interface&quot; on the player itself are for the most part intuitive (though it took me some time to figure out the more &quot;advanced&quot; features) and are  easy to use, even when you're fumbling around in your pocket to change a  song.The fact that the player is unskipable (it's not like MiniDisc  where they SAY it doesn't skip and it really does) and extremely  lightweight makes the Rio the perfect exercise companion; I take it on  every run.For 99% of purposes, 64 megabytes memory is enough (unless  you're a fan of 256 kb encoding). I can almost always fit ten or more songs  on the player, and changing them is easy enough. So don't worry about the  memory size-it's enough.The software (I use a Macintosh) is well done  and makes it very easy to transfer songs to the player itself. The only  thing I was less than perfectly happy with was the wait while the songs  copy (in the scheme of things, a very small flaw). The USB interface was no  problem at all, even on an older, less compatible iMac (Revision A).The  headphones included with the player are neat looking, but not great  sounding. The fidelity is low, with barely any low and low-mid-range sound.

First off they need to go it like hearing protection foam plugs. You squeeze and rotate the foam plug and insert it in your ear as you pull the top of your ear back with the other hand. They must be held in place for several seconds so the foam can expand and conform to your ear. If you insert them properly they do sound very good but with exaggerated bass.

"I love these cases, and have a few of them, and will get more.  No real complaints with them - sure reduced the amount of shelf space my DVDs required, and allows me to organize by genre.  The sleeves are held in a 3-ring binder, so they can be pulled out and re-arranged, too, so if you like to keep your DVDs alphabetically, you can pop a new CD into the stream without having to move every DVD like one would have to with the stupid other caselogic cases that don't have removable pages.  The material is strong adn well made.  I very much like the leather look and feel of the case, and they look sharp on the shelf.  The zippers are strong and well formed, the rivets are good, the binder material is sturdy. These babies will last for a good long time.My only complaint with this case - and also the 10 DVD holder from caselogic - is that they really don't hold that many without bulging or overpacking. I figure the 20 DVD holder averages about 18 discs, and the 10 holder gets 8 or 9.  Figure it this way - I have 8 of these holders. One holder when I bought it was missing 5 sleeves.  But even though I started 5 sleeves less I should have, it doesn't matter, becuase after filling all the holders to their capacity, I have about 20 sleeves left over that I can't use, becuase the case holders aren't big enough to hold as many DVDs as they say.The other caveat is that they have no place in which to put a label to let you know what's inside them.  I thought of putting stickers onthem, but realized that open and closing them would eventually force the stickers to come undone, and look ugly. So what I did, and I recommend this to you, is to make small cardstock labels with the contents of the case (I sort mine by genre, so mine say ""Action"" or ""Science fiction"", and each genre has it's own color scheme, etc. I did not put the movie names on the labels, cuz one never knows when one will need to move a movie to another case to make room for another, eh?), and then tied some string to them and put the string through the hole in the zipper handle. This system works wonderfully, and if you make really nice cards for them, they look good, too.For those two reasons, I only give these 4 stars.Those caveats aside, these are wonderful - the sleeves have room to put the front page or other amterials from the DVD, space for the disc itself (they can even fit 2 DVDs in them, for those double DVD sets like Star Wars).  They reduced my shelving needs by about 80%, and for that, it's worth the cost,...

The plain beige color is also nice if one has a  plain beige PC setup like I do.There are, however, a couple of problems  that I encountered.  Because of the lack of support for the right side of  one's palm, the pinky finger could get sore after sustained mouse use.  The  previous generation MS mouse does not have this problem it seems.  Also the  optics would not work correctly on certain type of surfaces; any surface  that is shinny/reflective, or too complicated like a photographic mouse  pad, the pointer will jump and skip pretty regularly.If one does not  mind the ergonomics of the mouse and use it on recommended surfaces, this  little device is about as good as they come.",4.0,B00004S9AK,957052800,Nice mouse though not perfect.

"Strait out of the packaging I hooked them up to my HDCD Denon player. Overall, they've got good highs and mids.  The 6khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is, but the high-end never gets  fatiguing at normal volumes - only when loud.  I must say that the bass is  a little exaggerated. It is noticeably overdone in the 30-80HZ region --  the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones. This never *seems* to  muddle the mids, which is often a problem with bass-heavy phones. It  doesn't seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of low-end dynamics,  which I did not expect. They remind me a lot of the Denon 950's, but  without the Denon's tissy-fit highs. When I hooked them up to my Panasonic  361C portable, I was surprised even further. With Curve: Doppelganger, the  bass didn't seem even the slightest bit exaggerated. Unfortunately, when I  moved over to extreme low-end intensive music like Massive Attack:  Mezzanine, there was still a little too much bass, but slightly less than  on the Denon. Econoline Crush: The Devil You Know kind of had too much  bass, but most people would probably prefer it that way. Yet, on many CD's  bass is noticeably overdone.  Spatially, the SportaPros have a nice open  sound.The SportaPros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes  out. When using the headband behind your head, the little fold-up hook can  start rubbing against my head, behind my right ear. This only happens when  the band slides too far down, though. All Koss had to do was have the hook  facing the opposite direction to avoid this. They're still the most  comfortable headphones-that-press-on-the-ear that I've ever tried, and I do  love how they fold up; it returns them to a nice, taught shape. The Koss  has a good, short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute  button on it.I'll keep the SportaPros as a portable and bass-y  alternative. If used with bass turned down a tad, they would be even  better.P.S. Single-entry wires are not superior.  They allow out of  phase cross-talk to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire,  which is why audiophile headphones are almost always dual-entry.  The  classic Sony V6, for instance, has a cross-talk problem and is unsuitable  for binaural applications because of this.",4.0,B00001P505,963360000,Good For The Price

"I've owned my Palm Vx for about a year and a half now. Despite the hype over much higher priced units, I still think it's one of the best PDAs out there.What I Like 1. Memory, and lots of it. If 8 Mb does not sound like a lot, think of what you're using a PDA for. There's plenty of room for the phone book and appointment book. That's 80% of what I use my Palm for. I've never run out memory. 2. Lots of freeware and cheap shareware add-ons. The most useful is the new Palm PDF Reader from Adobe. I can take important documents with me as a PDF and have them as a look up document. Other nifty utilities I've picked up include a travel alarm clock with World Time Zones, IP Calculator and some neat games to pass the time. Coming on strong are text document readers and databases. 3. Good monochrome display with adjustable contrast. Sure color on PDAs is a hot topic, but from what I've seen, color is not worth it on a PDA. The color is poor and it really decreases battery life. 4. Built in rechargabe power and long battery life. No hassle with batteries: drop it in the cradle and it recharges. I've gone as long as three weeks without recharging.What I Don't Like 1. I had to add PocketMirror to synch with Outlook. When I upgraded my desktop, the Outlook synch was lost until I purchased a new PocketMirror. I have no gripe with the performance, I just wish this was a standard feature 2. No expansion capability. I know I said it has enough memory, but I wish I could add an MP-3 player or use SmartMedia for archive storage. 3. It looks so nice I have to watch out someone dosen't &quot;adopt&quot; mine!PDA's are what most people really need when they say they need a laptop. If you really do need portable spreadsheets or data bases and total e-mail management capabilities, you *do* need a laptop and no PDA is going to fulfill your needs.

"I bought the Koss Porta and the Panasonic-RP-DJS400because my Grado I80 poofed into disintegration. I'm poor so who cares. Anyway. Lets go. The Koss Portapros are great if you are using an I pod such device. The sound they give is very clear and crisp. I actually hooked them up to my Onyko 110 Rms surround sound system at 70 volume level and they did not blow they did crackle but these are not a stereo headphone but close.The Koss PortaPro is the best lightweight headphone for hearing all the great variety of pings and pongs with booms for the money. The displacement with these is incredible. The sound comes in so clear and uniform you almost think your in the studio but not quite. They are worth it.I bought the Pana...screw it look above.. ok.. These are great head phones the song displacement is no where near as good as the Koss. Koss has a lot higher range than the Panasonic. The Panasonic I think were designed to give a bigger bass with less treble in the high notes but they sound the best at the highest volume. I personally like that. You listen to music loud to get into it. So you have to listen to these cans loud to enjoy them. They are very good and better than AKG M80 MK11.. for the price(10 bucks cheaper that the Koss).So whos the best.The Koss Portapro got it down in the sound department and the construction is very good. Koss also stood up to my Stereo.The Panasonic sound muffled compared to the Koss but not that much. Panasonic also can be played on your stereo and they vibrate with bass on your head..this can be annoying though. The Panasonic are built though wires won't fall out and you can depend on them on a 110 rms system to deliver the better than paid price for the sound. They are ok no Sennheiser or Grado , Sony Mdr  sound quality.I choose the Koss for my Ipods and laptops... But I choose the Panasonic for a pretty good home surround sound system.

"This was my first and only digital camera that I purchased as a display item will I was working at CompUSA. If I remember correctly, at the time this camera was over $300 but I got it for $50.I have no idea how old this camera was when I bought it, but despite that, it lasted an additional 3 1/2 years before it stopped working; the battery connections went bad. I took it apart to see if I could fix it, but to no avail.The 1.3 Megapixels was more than sufficent for me, it took crystal clear pictures everytime. I really enjoyed the LCD screen that showed in real time what the lens was looking at before you shot the picture. It also had a USB slot where you could easily tranfer the pictures to your PC. My only compaint about the camera was that the picture snapping was not instantaneous.This camera felt sturdy and built with quality materials. This camera had been dropped a few times, but it still functioned without any problems. I have taken thousands of pictures on this camera, not to mention the possible thousands that were taken before I came to own it, and I have been thourghly suprised with the durablity and quality of this camera.After my DC240 finally met its demise, I was dissapointed to find that Kodak no longer made cameras like this, instead they make these plastic, cheap looking, cheap feeling cameras that feel no way as sturdy as the DC series. I purchased a DX model a few months after this one died and took it back the next day because I was very dissapointed in the quality of the camera.

"I have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie DVDs.  Typically, I clean them by ""breathing"" on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs.  However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt.  This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a ""breath"" on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily.  The material is lint free and works as advertised.  20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack.  Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick.  I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle.  The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.

"As an organiser, it's really worth the price! It's unexpensive and extremely useful so that's why it's still in the market for so long.It has the basic functions of other advanced handhelds, but the only thing I need to do is organize. Instead of playing games you can learn or read, but don't buy a Palm to play games! An organiser is not a Game-Boy! Buy a Game-Boy instead of a Palm if you want to play games since it offers a complete game for a complete price. Playing a game on a Palm is like playing on an old computer, those that first came out for consumers, so it's slow, dumb, and expensive!What I found to be excellent:-You can have many, many alarm settings unlike all watches. It'a also an travelling clock or it will just replace yours at home. Different days, time, date, or year, no problem.-The Date Book seems to be better than paper and pen. Easy access and quick find. Want an alarm for everything you have to do? No problem.-The keyboard, sold seperately, seems to work flawlessly. You still can impress people by opening it or folding it and placing it in your pocket.-Some programs like shoplist, hackmaster, listmaker, handyshop, tinysheet(if you know how to find it), cookbook, and cspotrun can really help make things easier in your life. Free programs are all that we want and need.-Imagine how much time and money it will save you if you compared it to paper or a secretary. If you jot down everything you need and then retype it on your computer, you'll lose hundreds(total) of hours(of work?) doing so. With a keyboard, you can type anywhere(well almost), day or night, and the plastic smells nice(geek!).Most people complain about a lot of things, but you get what you pay for:-non-expansionnal-smaller screen-slow(16mhz), compared to others(33mhz)-expensive programs-expensive accessories-only 2 mb of memoryIf you want to have the top of the line gadget, don't buy the most inexpensive handheld. You don't need the expansion since it's maybe too expensive(one game=one game-boy games). Smaller screen means less battery usage but it doesn't mean less information! Speed? What? You'll only notice a fraction of a second difference. So what. What? Did you see the price on the cheap programs? Ridiculous. The only accessories you need are the keyboard, a case, and rechargeable batteries. Can you replace the internal batteries of other handhelds? I don't think so. Why do you need more memory when you only want to organize? More programs means more unstable. It WILL crash more often with other programs so it safer with basics. What? Do you want to lose all information on your Palm? What? [Of course not!] I never complained about memory since it's an organiser and I only used up one meg.This is basicly a handheld for those who don't want to spend much and who just want to organize!For those who can afford the cooler stuff, an Mp3 player, color screen(it's not how it looks on pictures!), expansion slot, more memory, voice recorder, and better programs are the best choices.

"The first thing a person has to decide when purchasing a handheld device is whether they want to use the Palm or the Windows CE operating systems.  I've found the Palm OS easy to use, very efficient, and well supported by third party developers, as well as by Palm.  The number of utilities available for the Palm OS really adds value to the product - particularly the web-enhanced synching utilities offered by everyone from Excite to AvantGo.  Using this free service lets you synch with any web page you select, so you always have the most current information available.  For example, I bookmarked the movie review page of an online newspaper in Toronto, and always had the most current reviews, times and locations of movies in Toronto, even though the online service wasn't specifically designed to operate with the Palm system.  Basically, any web page can reside on your Palm just by selecting it using this software.  I provide this as an example of the benefits of owning the industry standard OS rather than the less supported Windows CE. Now that I've mentioned why the Palm operating system is your best choice, I'll focus on the different Palm products available. Having used both the Palm IIIc, the Palm III, and the Palm Vx, I've got to say that the IIIxe really seems to hit the ideal price/feature point.  With all the memory of the more expensive models, and all the benefits of built-in synching to Microsoft Outlook and other software, it's a great little machine.  It also has an infrared port built in, which I was able to use to keep my home computer and my laptop at work (it has an IR port, too) synched with each other.  By the way, the IR port is also great for beaming your electronic business card to another Palm owner, or playing Battleship against another owner head-to-head. You can even set it up to let you write email messages, which will be stored in the Palm, and sent automatically when you next synch with your computer.  I mention this because it highlights the ability to personalize your Palm to do what you need it to do.  You can easily use it as a standalone device, or it can be as connected as you need it to be. There are three concerns you should be aware of when choosing this model over Palm's other offerings.  First, this model has a greyscale screen, not a colour one like the IIIc.  If you really want colour, this model isn't your best choice.  (You can read my review on the IIIc for more information on that product.)  Second, it has a plastic case which is thicker and less attractive than the brushed aluminum case of the V series of Palm organizers, which may be a concern for the more stylish among us.  Third, this one isn't rechargeable - it takes AAA batteries.  This might not sound like much of a concern, but there's something to be said for being able to drop the device into its cradle for a few minutes to recharge, rather than trying to limit your use of the organizer to conserve battery power.  One of my friends had a non-rechargeable model for years and purchased a new one with the rechargeable function.  He said he ended up using the organizer nearly twice as much as his old one, so this is probably something you should consider in your purchasing decision.  Notwithstanding these limitations, this is a great product with a great operating system, lots of features and third-party support, and is easy to learn and use.  Highly recommended!",5.0,B00004RC2D,977356800,A great deal for a lot of machine!

"I haved owned the Canon EF 28-80mm f/3.5-5.6 V USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras for nearly one year.  I purchased this lens used for a very small amount of cash. After learning what this lens does best ... I have been generally pleased with the exposures that I have made with it. Sometimes the exposures with it really pop and that has kept me from selling it.  This is so even after I have purchased ""better lenses.""  I did take some test shots to post.  See the bougainvilla, cat, and ""Wild Thing"" test images above.  Before uploading they looked a lot better. It is unfortunate that Amazon is unable to display good images.It has been my lot (my budget) to own a few of what the world has labeled ""bad lenses.""  In general, I have not found the  lens to be ""bad"" but instead to be a ""good lens when used appropriately.""  It does have its problems and it is not an L series quality lens.  But, I try to subscribe to the old quote that goes something like this:""It is a poor workman that blames his tools.""I am going to share excerpts from a posting that I read that has kept me from selling this lens.  I read this ""johnhopkins"" posting about this lens on the ""fredmiranda-com photo site."" Johnhopkins from the United Kingdom posted it Sep 20, 2005 according to ""fredmiranda-com.""  The poster ""johnhopkins"" stated that he had tested this lens against a Canon 24-70L.  He found that:""The 28-80 could not match the Canon 24-70L in colour and contrast, but at f/11 there was no difference in resolution anywhere in the zoom range. At 28mm the 28-80 performed pretty respectably (though not as well) relative to the L zoom. Resolution at f/11 was identical to the L and only a little worse at f/5.6-f/8.Performance drops off further in the zoom range. At 50mm the 28-80 performed as well as the 24-70L at f/8-11 but resolution tailed off at f/5.6 and especially at f/4.5. The corners especially were poor.At 70mm the 28-80 only really performed well at f/11. Resolution was still OKish at f/8 but tailed off badly at f/5.6.""My recent tests of the lens and my use of the lens for the most part confirms the (fredmiranda-com,johnhopkins) conclusion that:""If used at f/11 anywhere in its zoom range or at f5.6-f/11 at 28mm then this lens can produce very decent results. Set the camera to Aperture Priority f/11 and leave it there if possible."" I to have also found that my copy has decent performance at 28mm.I think that this lens is a good value for just a little cash.",5.0,B00004THCX,1286236800,A Diamond in the Rough: A Good Affordable Tool When Used To Advantage
My first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations. You can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones.

"So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three)  have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more  like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically  easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the  screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for  the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a  stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the  plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my  girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly  go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one,  buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",5.0,B00000J08C,962928000,You don't know how much you need them until you lose them.
"Purchased this to replace my $10 Sony ear buds. Sony is not bad, but sounds a little dry and boring. I was surprised to hear the sound improved even when connected to a PC. Bass sounds more natural (not over emphasized as woofers do), and mid-range sounds fuller. Yo-Yo Ma sounds better with this compare to Sony.Even though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones, I still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while. I think it is the case for almost any headphone.However, this is not the best for conversation. I prefer my cheapo ear bud for Skype, which sounds a lot clearer. This is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear bud's frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resources.By the way, I got a chance to try a Koss TD-80. This Portapro beats TD hands down in sound quality. If you enjoy music, but not on an AM radio or very compressed files, give this a try.Update: to improve the clarity in conversation (Skype) or vocal, I cut a hole in the center of the foam pad. Now everything works beautifully. By the way, its cheaper to order replacement pads through Amazon.

"I bought this set primarily to be able to recharge my DVD player battery, which has a 120V-only AC adapter, rather than the 120/240V capability that many chargers for cell phones, cameras, and videocams, as well as hair dryers and razors, now have. If the device (or its charger) is 120/240V, you only need a plug adapter to fit the electrical outlet.The voltage converter worked perfectly and allowed me to recharged the DVD battery, via its AC adapter power cord, half a dozen times. I had the wattage switch on ""low"" (0-50W) for this use. I would award four and a half stars if I could, because I never used it with a high wattage appliance, and hence cannot attest that it works as well under such conditions.I sometimes travel with a portable hair dryer, but it has a dual voltage switch, so I only use it with a plug adapter. Additionally, the dryer is in the neighborhood of 1600 watts, so I would be reticent to try an appliance at the top of the converter's stated wattage range.",5.0,B000028F42,1140739200,Has worked perfectly so far on two European trips

"Of all the PDAs I have owned, this was the first with a color display.  You may have heard others say it before, and I will definately agree - once you go color you never go back.  I was impressed with the screens ability to display colors.  You might expect Palm's first try at a color screen to only be partially successful.  But, they did quite well.  While the screen may be lack the brightness to be easily read in bright sunlight.  It does allow for the use of the PDA when in a poorly lit room.  Which is the more common scenario.Unlike some of other previous Palm III models, the IIIc features 8mb of storage and an internal, reachargable battery.  I used this PDA on a daily basis for over a year and only noticed a very slight reduction in the battery's ability to hold a charge and I can not express how thrilled I was to no longer have to purchase batteries for my PDA.What did I not like?  Of course there is the fact that 5 months after the IIIc came out, Palm decided to release its new line of 500 series with SD/MMC slots.  Not as though I could have predicted it.  The IIIc also comes with an attached flip cover to protect your screen.  There is the option to remove the cover if you find it rather annoying.  Which I did.  Instead of the cover included, I would have preferred something closer to what the iPAQ used - a hard flip cover for the screen that allowed navigation with the buttons while still permitting the user to view the screen.If you are looking for a PDA with mulitmedia features, this is not the one for you.  If you want a PDA that is capable of holding documents, contact information, games, and can do so in color, then the IIIc will suit you quite well.",5.0,B00004RC2E,1065052800,First color PDA

"I was looking for a radio in case of emergency situations, and this was the perfect solution.  More people have CB's then any other type of radio because of the truck drivers, so I know there's a better then average chance I could reach someone else in an emergency with this radio.  I live fairly close to one of the busiest freeways in the U.S., and can get a signal with this if I step outside of my house.  I purchased a simple magnetic car antenna, and love how easy it is to swap this from car power to handheld power, so I know I'll be ready either way.the sound isn't super loud, but I can drive with the heater on full blast and the windows cracked on the freeway and hear it if it's near my head.  I've had no complaints about the sound quality, and get fairly good reception (so far 4 miles with the car mounted antenna for certain)Most CB's require a calibrated antenna of a certain length for maximum range, so I'm certain I could get farther range with a smal amount of effort, this functions as well as my old truck mounted CB I had when professionally driving.Great for camping, we talked the whole way down with the car mounts, then kept in touch in the park with the handheld packs.  Has a powersave option that keeps you going as long as your batteries can stand (I had to buy 8 rechargeable AA batteries seperately for the charger pack)  We did have a few issues when on the far side of the park from each other, but getting to higher ground put us back in touch again (this was a mapped distance of 6 miles from hilltop to hilltop)I've had otehr small scale cig lighter powered radios and this one has been better in every reguard.  The unit doesn't overheat, hasn't blown a fuse, and functions just like you'd expect a quality item to.  Standard mounts and plugs for everything but a talk mic.  You can purchase a headset unit, or else you'll have to use this as if it were a Standard CB mic, but you can easily plug any headphone jack in for headphone or external speaker sound.Overall this is a really functional, solidly built, hybrid design for the non-professional driver in need of a radio.

This year I bought a Dell Vostro laptop. It turns out that many/all have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise  especially when using earbud headphones. Someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence. I didn't expect it to work but it does. The Koss VC20 reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable.

"I started with a Compaq CE 1.0 device some years ago.  Shortly after I upgraded to a Palm III, then moved to the Visor Deluxe in March, 2000.  I really enjoyed the flexibility of the Visor add-ons, but felt limited on the software side.  The Jornada has been wonderful!  Syncing capabilities are right there with the Visor, though the option settings aren't as clearly defined as they could be.  Writing recognition is head &amp; shoulders above the Visor, the word completion option is a tremendous time saver.  The display doesn't hit the 16 bit category, but it is still impressive.  Outside it is difficult to view without fiddling with the settings.  The display catches a lot of attention from onlookers. Software is a huge advantage.  Pocket  Word &amp; Pocket Streets have been a huge help(this critique was written in Pocket Word).  Small display size makes the Excel version difficult to use.  The inclusion of Outlook 2000 is an added bonus.  I look forward to adding Pocket Powerpoint. I was very concerned about the lack of flexibility on the power system (the Visor uses AAA's), however the Lithium Ion battery holds it's own very well.  I am getting well over six hours of operation time between charges. I installed a 56k modem and the results have been great.  Setup was a snap &amp; operation speeds have been impressive.  Power adapter is pretty much required with modem use. There is a noticeable lag in program opening compared to the Palm OS, but nothing that's going to cause me heartburn. Though there are a few disadvantages with the HP and CE 3, they are far outweighed by the long list of advantages.  It is a definite buy.",5.0,B00004TDL2,970185600,Jornada 548 replaces Visor Deluxe

"After a year+ with Sennheiser's HD 595s and a few days with these, I can tell you confidently that these have improved sound.  They are a bit more neutral and more extended, with tighter, stronger bass as well as better defined highs.But I'm not sure they were worth the money, given that I already had a pretty good set of cans in the HD 595.They are discernably better (even w/o burn-in) but the comparative listening I've done indicates that the 595s are well within the ""same league.""  Had I had the good sense to test both before buying either one, I would have spent the extra $$ on these.  The imaging (location of instruments and voices) is notably better (though the 595 is very good), and the dynamic range seems to be modestly better (tighter and stronger bass).  But since I already own the 595s, I'm not quite sure about whether to indulge myself by keeping these headphones or sending them back.I'm darned sure that, if I didn't already own the 595s, I'd be keeping them happily.",5.0,B00004SY4H,1235606400,"FANTASTIC, but not ""way better"" than HD 595s"

"I've been sharing a DSL connection between 2 computers for over two years using WinProxy, and I've never been completely satisfied with that.

Now I don't need to use Earthlink's WinPoEt to log in, the router does it for me.  I just turn either computer on, and I've got internet access.I found setup to be a breeze.  I connected the router, pulled up with Router's webpage style controls using Internet Explorer, told it I was using PPPoE, my earthlink user name and password, and I was done.  That, and I had to undo all the proxy settings I set up for WinProxy, but if you aren't using a software solution right now, that's not something you'll need to worry about.Incidently, the router also functions as a network hub.

"The Nikon Coolpix 990 has been a great camera-I'm extremely pleased with it.  This is a good choice for an experienced or ambitious amateur photographer.  Most of my previous experience has been with a Panasonic that cost a little over half what this one did.  In comparison to that camera, the Nikon has better color saturation, is quicker at the draw, and of course has more features....  I've been very pleased with the way that the 990 allows control over both shutter speed and aperture, color balance, focus and metering points and several more obscure settings.All digital cameras are battery pigs, and this is no exception.  A good  optical viewfinder (including support for zoom) is important in a camera like this for two reasons.  First, the color screen is useless in bright sunlight, but second, it provides you with a battery-saving option of turning off the monitor.  An LCD screen on top of the camera provides a readout on the most common settings (aperture, shutter speed, resolution &amp; quality, storage, 'ISO', flash settings, manual focus distance).  Japanese electronics tend to have lots of features, reached through obscure combinations of buttons.  While I would hardly categorize this camera as being 'completely intuitive,' most of the functions are pretty easy to operate.  The more advanced settings are reached through a tabbed menu on the monitor, which is reasonably easy to use.  I've also found that the monitor is very accurate in both brightness and tone.  The monitor has several different modes-if you leave it turned on, the default mode is to superimpose some of the most-used camera settings over the picture.  This is similar to but not a complete duplicate of the readout on the top LCD screen.  You can also leave the menu on, superimposing it over the image.  While this covers part of the image, it also makes menu options available for immediate use.  Unless you are in very bright light, what you see on the monitor after taking a picture is what you get-I've never been disappointed that a picture didn't turn out like it appeared on the monitor (brightness and hue are adjustable).  Although the monitor is small, the view feature lets you zoom in and scroll around on stored images so that you can look at them more closely.The configuration of the camera is unusual, splitting the viewfinder, lens and flash from the other half of the camera and allowing their separate rotation.  I usually don't rotate the lens, but sometimes it is convenient to do so, allowing you to take pictures over your head or around corners.  I bought a small minipod and found that the rotating lens assembly provides some extra flexibility when clamping the camera to whatever happens to be available.  The on-board flash is OK, but the red-eye reduction facility doesn't work very well.  If you don't use an off-camera flash, you're living with substandard lighting anyway, but there are more effective red-eye reduction systems on other built-in flashes.It doesn't matter how slick the controls are, or how good it looks if it doesn't take acceptable pictures.  I've been quite please with the camera's performance in many different light conditions.  I've had fun capturing the Christmas lights in Z&uuml;rich, and my best picture was a misty Fall scene on Mt. Pilatus with yellow and red leaves.  It took me 6 tries to get the exposure right (that's why you buy a camera like this), but it perfectly captured that dreamy backlit scene and its Autumn colors.  Pictures don't always come out as rich as negative film, but they aren't bad and when they are good, they can be very good.I've found that close-ups work well, and macro mode is fun.  I've even used my 990 to copy signs or even pages in a book.  It is a quick way to capture text that you need to refer to later.  After you've taken a picture of a diagram or text, view it and use the zoom function to make sure that what you've just taken is legible in the monitor.The camera has more continuous shooting options than I know what to do with.  The multi-shot 16 feature lets you create a single collage that consists of 16 pictures.  That's the kind of gimmick that you can't use very often without wearing out your audience's patience.  If you want to create a short movie, though, you can do that too.Speaking of night pictures, I had a terrible time figuring out the self-timer.  When you put it in self-timer mode, the close-up icon (flower) comes on, and so does the red eye icon.  It turns out that you are stuck with this configuration, which isn't really optimal for night scenes. ...  Given the availability of multi-second shutter speeds, and a sensitivity adjustment providing an effective speed of ISO 400, some owners will undoubtedly pay for the MC-EU1 release, and the bulb setting is pretty much useless without it.I like the USB cable.  Once you've loaded Nikon View on your computer, connecting the camera to a USB port and turning it on automatically makes the camera accessible as if it were a removable drive.  I've been traveling with just the USB cable and find it a very convenient way to pull pictures into my laptop and delete them from the memory card.  Connection of the USB cable automatically turns off the color monitor, and subsequent battery drain seems to be low....  I think most Nikon owners would appreciate a more advanced text than this, but it is comprehensive and has helped me better utilize my camera.In summary, automatic operation is very good, and if desired, this camera offers the ability to control every aspect of the photography process.  It has less waiting time than many other digital cameras I've used, it is relatively easy to use, and it takes good pictures.  It's a winner!",5.0,B00004RDMR,977011200,"I really like this camera, good choice for ambitious amateur"

"Let me echo the raves. I just purchased my 3rd pair. I plug them directly into my Access Virus KC or Minibrute or UltraNova or any one of my several instruments and they make me smile. I hear what I play exactly as it sounds on my studio near field monitors. The highs, midrange and base sound perfect. The center feels exactly correct and the instruments seem placed exactly where they should be as do the vocals. Sometimes I think that the V6's are surround sound they are that good.I've tried other brands and other Sony's as well but for this price I'm getting a $200-esque pair of cans. I saw them for $300 on another site. Really? That's too much, but 10 years ago I paid $129 for them and now they're $76 on Amazon. If you mix music, DJ, or just like listening to music then these are for you. I'm glad that Sony still makes them. My second pair still sounds great but they're a little ratty for wear. I've replaced the ear pads twice and the headpad is completely wrapped in duct tape and I lost the carrying bag that came with it. So, this time I decided to get a new pair just in case Sony stops making them.There are better cans out there, to be sure, but they cost a lot more. I read a few reviews where the reviewers said that they'd found a $40 pair of 'phones that were just as good but ... that's right, they started to list a series of buts like the competetion was a little less comfortable, too light or too tight or felt too fragile or the highs were slightly tinny, or weak mids or the bass bottomed out.

"With over 1000 reviews on these why add yet another.  Aw, what the heck...I purchased my first pair of MDR-V6s when they first came out in the 80s.  You need to realize that a driver that could faithfully reproduce sound down to and BELOW 20Hz was unheard of in consumer audio at that time.  These phones stunned me when I was able to hear content on certain recordings that I had never heard before - mostly in the spectrum from 80Hz and down.  This was an unusual experience via headphones.  The clarity and truthfulness of the audio the MDR-V6s produce is stunning to those who value accurate audio reproduction.  Their ability to deliver very high volume levels without distortion is a joy (in moderation - doing this too often WILL result in hearing loss). They are even more stunning when one considers the price compared to the more esoteric audiophile phones available that can run 10 to 20 times more in price.I had that first pair of phones for about 12 years before someone stepped on the frame and snapped one of the driver's clean off.  I replaced them with a new pair which I still own.  They are pushing 15 years old now and still sound very good.  After an estimated 5000 hours of use, the ear pads are flaking off and the left driver had begun to occasionally break-up on high volume, low frequency content.  So I have ordered my third pair of these beauties over the course of almost 30 years.  Thank you, Sony, for continuing to manufacture this excellent product at an amazing price.A popular trend in headphone design today involves intentional gain manipulation over certain frequencies - mostly on the low end (Beats by Dr. Dre).  If they sound good to you, who am I to tell you different?  I personally enjoy hearing recordings as close to their original mix as possible.  The MDR-V6s do that extremely well.  When you can actually hear the full audio spectrum delivered with very little coloration, you might be surprised at how enjoyable some recordings are with little or no adjustments to the equalization.The only shortcoming on these phones is the fact that the wire that runs from the left ear cup up and over to the right ear cup is exposed where it travels over the stainless steel band on each side. This is a pretty small gauge wire and if you accidentally pulled on it when removing the earphones or pulling them out of a backpack, there is a possibility of the wire being damaged.  And if that wire is ever broken, it is basically impossible to repair.  Nearly all headphones use very fine stranded, coated wiring.  The coating makes it practically impossible to repair once broken.  It cannot be soldered or twisted together.  So if you are rough with your phones, consider this.If accuracy is important to you look no further.  Buy these, then buy a backup pair!",5.0,B00001WRSJ,1365552000,"Super flat, pure sound phones"
"Okay, it doesn't use batteries, it doesn't light up, and it doesn't cost a lot. But this headset/boom mic is an essential accessory for the TalkAbouts for this simple reason: TalkAbouts have voice-operated control (VOX) when  used with a plugin headset/mic. We have also evaluated the earbud/mic combo  for bike riders and found it almost unworkable (it picks up road noise and,  to me, the earbud causes excruciating pain after a day of use). The headset  is a much better solution. The band actually fits OVER a safety helmet, and  the closed-foam-cell rubber pad grips the plastic shell securely. The boom  mic rejects most road noise, and soon becomes forgotten in the course of  routine use. (It quickly comes back to the foreground when I try to sip  from my water bottle!) If you purchase one of the TalkAbouts, consider this  as your second accessory purchase -- your first should be a carrying  holster or case.

"I am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me. So, I have all the very expensive stuff, including KODAK's $20m commercial digital cameras. So, I know what quality  is and how much it costs. Bottom-Line as starters, the DC280 makes great  color shots with very suprising Hi-detail. The Advertisments say  &quot;good&quot; for 8x10 photos, however, as a very picky guy, when you  get past 5x7 print sizes, the pictures start to turn fuzzy. But the 5x7  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors. But, so what, how many  prints does one make larger than 5x7 anyway. This camera is easy to use  &amp; small, and I carry it on vacation locations, when I don't want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera. I was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the 280. ALSO, KODAK includes great software,  so after a picture taking day/nite, one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your TV (or Hotel TV) for a slide show of the days  activities. I would recommend purchasing a 64MB memory card with the camera  purchase, so you'll get plenty of picture opportunities (75+ shots) without  having to worry about using up memory. In other words, since you can erase  shots you don't like, take MANY, MANY shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or e-mailing. I bring my laptop with me on trips, so in the  evening, I can copy the photo-files to the hard disk, and erase the camera  memory card, in preparation for the next days photo activities. KODAK  provides serial, USB cables, and software to accomplish this simply.  Definitely do NOT buy a digital camera with less than 2,000,000 pixels.  (The older models, presently having good sale prices, are technology of 2/3  years ago, and you'll wish you spent the extra money for this camera).  Since KODAK has been the color business for 100 years, (well...50+years)  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager (the CCD Chip)  with the BEST Color quality and detail. This is a must have, you'll not be  dissappointed. If you have another few hundred dollars, check out the SONY  or OLYMPUS dye-sublimation printers, which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to 4x5 sizes; These printers are not dot-matrix's  with all the little dots. The camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under $2m, that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer, as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card. SO that you don't make yourself craze, and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera, be sure to  read the instruciton booklet, before pushing all the buttons. The  documentation KODAK gives you is very easy to understand, so take it slow  when you open the Box for the first time. It's so intuitive to use, after  the first 2 outings, you NOT need to keep going back to the booklets.  JLW/991203.",5.0,B000038AB2,944179200,Excellent Color and Detail

With the quality and comfort of them and at about $5 per unit, I don't mind if I buy twenty over the next few years.For myself, I purchased RP-HT46-S.

"These Koss PortaPro Headphones work great!  Normally the only thing I care about with headphones is how durable they are, though ever since I became an adult, and my head got bigger, I suppose the size and comfort is another thing that needs to be taken into consideration!I used to have REALLY horrible luck with headphones back in the 90's.  The headphones would always lose the volume in one side of the speaker so I'd have to constantly keep readjusting them and twisting the end piece attached to the stereo equipment to get the volume back.  It was annoying.  This problem still exists from time to time, but these particular type of Koss headphones haven't been giving me this particular problem and I'm VERY happy about that.  Nothing worse than when your favorite moment of a song comes on, and BAM- the volume drops out from one side.I highly recommend everyone purchase a pair of these headphones.",5.0,B00001P4ZH,1326758400,reliable
I bought this exclusively to use withCanon EOS 60Dand I happy to report that this cable works flawlessly with this camera.I was initially concerned about the quality based on the price it is been offered and also was worried that the extra length (10 Ft) would be an issue when it comes to signal degradation etc; But as the cable is of good quality I did not notice any sync issues or signal degradation.Having the extra length allowed me to keep the camera close to me on the couch and view the breath taking pictures and 1080p videos that theCanon EOS 60Dis capable of.It is a nice cable very good purchase!Highly recommended! - Get one to use with any device that has a Mini HDMI interface.,5.0,9983891212,1328572800,Great price!

"I bought these as a replacement to the cheap headphones I received with my three tone detector, which lasted about 18 months of on and off use as I use ear buds in the summer heat. They are well made and have a substantial cord length which makes them ideal for setting the detector down and working away from the unit. Although I have gathered up the excess cable and zip tied it off on the shaft where it's out of the way. These are EXACTLY the same as what other retailers offer, but without the camouflage, for $30 less. Oh, and the size of the muffs really help keep your ears warm in chilly, windy weather. The only negative I can think of is that the cord is not made of a silicon rubber which doesn't get stiff in cold weather.

I would agree with those reviewers who said they would be perfect for use in live theater or the opera.

Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch.

"I bougt my KOSS Porta Pro in 1992 for usage on a Walkman.The day I bought it I believe must have changed my life ;-)Up to now (16 years !!) I did not find any portable headphone that delivers more sound.What makes this headphone so special is the dynamic it reproduces.The bass and treble that comes from this tiny package sounds like you are in front of a speakerwall.There are no words to describe the atmosphere it creates.When listening to classic music concerts its like you are there.When listening to a singer its like the stage is in front of you.When listening to pop, rock, disco, dancefloor, techno - you name it - it delivers the pump you would expect from BIG speakers.The clear vibrant trebles and the full deep bass it produces are just stunning.I still remember the first time I used those, the sound was so amazing it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling in the upper stomach area and left me speechless for a moment.Note that over time the earpads and the pads which are supposed to hold the headphone in place will wear out and eventually come off. This can be a major turnoff when you want to go jogging with it.I dont recommend wearing them long time or when you want to sleep (because of the pressure on the ears).The little blue ""comfortzone"" switch is supposed to set how firm the headphone is attached to your head. I don't think that's working as advertised, whatever the settings it didn't feel any different for me. The headphone is very light and foldable. When folded they are the size of a small apple.The headphone comes with a softcase.Summary:The speakers are not as compact as in-ear plugs but definitely have a better form factor than most pro headphones.The fact that mine are worn out after many years of usage but still used confirms that the sound itself is well worth the price.When listening - especially first time - be prepared to be left speechless.

"I am %100 satisfied with this purchase.  If these disappeared, I would buy a replacement set immediately.The build quality is top notch, much better than you'd expect from the photo.  Other headphones have chinsy hinges, or oversized plastic hinges to appear that they are built well, but when you feel these in your hands, you will know that they will last.  The cord and plug are both pro grade also.The audio quality is great.  Are there better sounding phones?  maybe.  I've had some very expensive Sennheisers, Sonys, a few random off brands and a pair of Grados, all which sounded great.  These Sony's hang with them.  If you can find a pair that sounds better, that pair will be $500, and it won't blow these Sony's out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few details.Comfort is good.  The foam goes fully around your ear(circumaural) and they are a closed can design so they &#34;block out&#34; outside sounds.  They aren't &#34;noise isolating&#34; or &#34;noise reducing&#34;, but they block enough to put you in your own audio space.  If you listen with these, you won't hear the phone ringing in the other room.  If you have sweaty ear syndrome or don't like headphones that are closed, these might not be up your alley.  That is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones.  I personally really like the closed, circumaural design.  The band and the ear pressure are exactly right.  In ten years, after you've worn through the ear pads, replacements will still be readily available online.Overall, these are the industry standard for a reason.

"Last year, I helped my cousin install his Palm V to work with his desktop. Thought it was a neat device but, did not want to buy one for myself at the time; thinking that my laptop was good enough for what I need to do. Stupid decision !I finally bought myself a Palm Vx this August and it has changed the way I use and access information on the move. It's forte is dependable connectivity and it does that so well. The Vx ships with Chapura PocketMirror, which an excellent sync/conduit manager, optimised for Outlook users (97-2000) and is a breeze to set up. PocketMirror integrates seamlessly with Palm's own desktop manager - just follow the instructions and you will be able to hotsync all your data in Outlook, literally within minutes. The Vx also ships with AvantGo, which is perfect for those of you who want to browse your favourite websites off-line and on the move (it syncs with your chosen sites every time you hot-sync; just a push of a button away).There is no point dwelling on the number of addresses, memos, etc. that the Vx can store, since these are pretty much the industry standard with other brands too and realistically, it is unlikely that you will ever run out of space for these items. The 8MB in the Vx comes in handy when you use applications such as AvantGo and if you tend to keeps hundreds of messages in your Outlook inbox (like I do!).I have recently added Documents to Go ([...] a 3rd party add-on. This software brings Word and Excel files into my Vx and now, I no longer have to use my laptop for every important document or spreadsheet I need to access quickly in a meeting or whilst on the phone - it's all there in the Palm of my hand (pun intended) !If I had a Palm wish, I guess a colour version of the Vx would be the ultimate; though, knowing the folks at Palm, this is probably around the corner (since they have already released a colour version of the III series - the IIIc). I guess I would also like to have my 'Sent Items' mailbox from Outlook in my Palm - there probably is software available somewhere on the Net which does this, but I haven't found it as yet.Bottom-line.

Well, I don't have to do that any longer. I have the Koss Volume Control clipped on the wire part of my Sony headphones and I'm good to go. I owned one before but I must have lost it during relocating and I was really missing it.(I will update this review if any problems arise from this device).",5.0,B00001P4XH,1364083200,Nice little device.
"This is what you need if you use a Palm and have a USB Mac (blue G3, G4, or iMac).  Works flawlessly, unlike the first two 3rd party solutions  (Belkin and a no-name) I tried to use.

"This is the best pointing device I have ever owned.  Much better than a mouse, and leagues better than the Microsoft trackball I used before this one.I bought the TrackMan because I was experiencing some fatigue on my right shoulder from using my mouse so much.  I had used a trackball before (the Microsoft I mentioned previously), but never liked it because the ball kept sticking. I wanted to try another trackball rather than another mouse.  I read the reviews here, and decided on the Logitech TrackMan. I was not disappointed.The feel is very comfortable, and the action is smooth.  The supplied driver software allows plenty of customization of the buttons and pointer speed.I love the acceleration feature.  I have two monitors, and getting the pointer from one to the other is a breeze.The TrackMan was so easy to install.  It started working as soon as I had installed the battery and plugged the wireless receiver into my computer, even before I had installed the driver or pressed the 'communicate' buttons!The driver software provides superb functionality, so I do advise using it even if the Trackman will work without.If you are used to using a mouse, you may need a little time to become proficient with the trackball, but in the end I believe this is the way to go.All in all, I am completely happy with this device.",5.0,B00004VUGJ,1168646400,A pleasure to work with

"As one person noted, there is not much you can say about a tripod.  This Vivitar is light, easy to handle and carry.  Great for the hobbyist.  It has a nice tight fluid motion, feels stable, and the quick release allows for switching from camcorder to digital or 35mm camera on demand.  Vivitar managed to get a lot out of a light weight tripod on this one.  It should work for any amature and some serious filming.  No, it is not the professional model, but it certainly will work great for anything short of professional requirements.",5.0,B00004RIGR,1004227200,Great Value

"I have had a pair of Koss PortaPro headphone since they came out about 20 years ago.  They are the best. I believe they were once top-rated by CU.  They have wonderfull bass, clear sound, are comforable to wear.  They are low priced.  They have a life-time warrenty for $6 S&H repair or replacement by Koss.  How may other headphones have this?

"I've had a Linksys gigabit switch for a few years and was never really pleased with it. Recently, it started acting up and finally gave out completely.I bought this 10/100 because it was cheap. I was a bit worried because it wasn't gigabit but it works fine. A network expert would probably tell me that a gigabit switch was surplus to requirements for home use. A 10/100 that works is infinitely better than a 10/100/1000 that doesn't work.I use this for streaming - Roku 2 XS, WD-TV, Sonos, Hopper. Actually, the Hopper is sort of a reverse streaming thing. It has a Slingbox on it.",5.0,B00003006K,1357516800,It works perfectly
"I can't improve on what's already been said about these phones.  Sound as good as my Grado SR60 at about half the size and cost.  Seem to be very well constructed but I've only had them a few days.Stayed in place on my head through a sweaty 6-mile jog this morning.  First time I've had my tunes along on a jog and I highly recommend it.I run on a busy highway so I wanted to be able to hear outside noises for safety.  I could hear the traffic and the music.  With no outside noise, the music is just incredible.  I use 320kbps mp3 mostly and, although I have a pretty good pc stereo setup (M-AUDIO, Kenwood, Bose), I heard not only new musical nuances but words which I had not previously recognized.I don't pretend to be an audiophile and my hearing has gone downhill but I've been into music a long time.  We're into SACD, DVD-Audio with Klipsch and Polk speakers so I think I've heard some pretty good music.  I was still impressed with the clarity and fidelity of these little phones.  Oh, I've tried them with both my pc stereo setup and through a Sansa Clip player.  Both sound terrific.They don't look as hip as the little buds but they don't look totally dork either.  Cable is plenty long enough for me.  Now, I did hear a slight click with each jogging step which I think is just the wire slapping the phones or movement of the ear cup itself.  It may begin to bother me and if so I'll try to eliminate it but today it just helped me maintain a steady pace and didn't detract from the music at all.I think most people will really like these phones.  I definitely do.",5.0,B00001P4ZH,1226188800,Glad I bought these babies!
"I have been using M cartridges for my P-Touch for years to label anything and everything, including all of those pesky cords and chargers that seem to multiply around the house. We kept ending up with boxes of cords and cables that no one quite knew what they went to, and in many cases they went to devices that had been tossed long ago. By labeling cords when they come in the door, I can better keep track of them and eventually dispose of them without fear of reprisal. The adhesive lasts indefinitely (I haven't had any come loose in the time I have been using the product) and the cartridges dispense correctly every time.",5.0,B00000K135,1395014400,Continues to do just what it is designed for
"The very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge. I've seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big, but I think they're terrific. I have big ears, so these are perfect for me.The only CON is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders. When you pull the headset to fit your head, the sliders that change the head size will shrink.Overall: 9/10",5.0,B00001P4ZR,1399766400,Big Ear Cups

I use these every day at work. Comfortable. Great sound. Much better build and sound quality than any other pair I've owned. Tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly Beats but couldn't do it. Sound quality is a distant second to looks apparently.Could only be better by allowing for easy cord removal.

"I work all day in front of a computer.  I have been feeling strain in my forearms and wrists, especially on the right side.Uh oh, the dreaded carpal tunnel!I needed to get something to relieve the pain and to prevent any permanent damage (hopefully, I'm not too late!).  My workstation is ergonomically sound (keyboard tray with negative angle, proper monitor height, good chair, etc.).  The mouse and keyboard have been causing problems.I first tried the 3M Ergonomic Mouse.  This provided some relief, but still having to move my arm around caused strain.This mouse is much better.  It allows me to leave my hand and arm in a comfortable position.  The trackball is very easy to use.  I was up and running rather quickly.  It only took me about a day to get used to it.If you are feeling strain in your wrists and arms, then I would highly recommend getting this product.Now all I need is a better keyboard...",5.0,B00004VUGJ,1201132800,nice relief for carpal tunner suffer
"I was very disappointed in the reviews, and I had decided not to purchase this lens, but then I read the review by John Nolley II.  After reading his review, I purchased it.  I have had it for a few days now, and I am very happy with it.  I have not found any focus problems.  It acts exactly like my Canon 55-250mm Telephoto lens.  Most of my shots (about 99%) are Nature and Landscape.  Every now and then I photograph my grandchildren playing sports.  My first test of the lens was shooting birds in my backyard.  They do not sit still very long, so I was constantly focusing and refocusing, and it was fast enough for me.  I see no difference at all with the operation of this lens and my Canon 55-250mm.  The only thing it does lack is Image Stabilization.  I found myself turning the Image Stabilized button off for most shots with my 55-250mm, and I always use a tripod anyway, so it is not needed for me.Thank you John, I would not have purchased this lens had it not been for your review.By the way, I was able to sell my used 55-250mm on ebay for $107 minus $9 shipping & insurance costs (sold in a few hours), so I figure this lens cost me about $30.oo Net!I absolutely love this lens.",5.0,B00004THCZ,1366070400,Almost Did Not Buy Because of Negative Reviews.

"I recently purchased my second Sony ICF-S79V to replace the first one I purchased almost seven years ago!  That's right...  my first Sony ICF-S79V lasted almost seven years which is why I had no problem replacing it with the same model.  The reason why I had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time.  The second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid / wet conditons.  I would totally recommend this product because it looks great, last a long time, gets great reception, a huge amount of digital presets and much more!",5.0,B00000DM9W,1195603200,Excellent Shower Radio
"I use this with my Visor, and it works great in keeping my visor safe from the hazards of everyday life.  But what works best for me is that I use it as a wallet.  I used to have a big fat trifold wallet, but using this has forced me to dump all the extra stuff I was carrying around.  Now I have my PDA and my credit cards, ID's and cash, all in one easy location.  Sure it might be nice to have a thinner package, but I would need a thinner PDA first.

"ATTENTION BUSINESS TRAVELLERS: This unit works very well on an airplace service tray and folds up nicely when not in use. I hate bulky carry on bags and this combo can fit in your pockets!What else do I like about it?(1) Works perfect. Every time, no problems. Very reliable.(2) The keys feel good and it is easy to type fast.(3) Wow factor. This is an innovative device that expands whatyou can do with your Visor without comprimising portability.(4) Folds up nicely and tucks away in a sturdy outershell case.(5) Compatibility.

You load a driver onto your desktop, Hotsync it into your Visor and then connect the keyboard.There is a keyboard icon on your Visor that has an option to turn the keyboard on and off. At times I have had to reactivate the keyboard whenever I hook it up, but that only entails unchecking the activate box and then re-checking it.The keyboard has a slide out docking station that supports the visor from the back side.I bought my Visor to keep track of information and to access the web wirelessly. I quickly learned it was possible to access my spreadsheets and other Microsoft Office documents and be able to edit and save them on my Visor.That, of course, led to needing a keyboard. I am good at the graffiti, but nothing beats the keyboard when it comes to a lot of data entry.

If  you you the card with a Olympus D460 camera, you can take over 300 pictures  at highest resolution.  For a little more money than the Olympus 32 mb card  you get twice the capacity. The only difference is that you can't take  panoramic shots. Save your 8 mb card for that. The nice thing about the  added memory for the camera is now I can take it on vacation and snap as  many pictures as I want without worrying about downloading them to a PC. My  next purchase will be a USB card reader because the serial connection on my  digital camera is painfully slow.",5.0,B00004SCKA,968284800,Good choice if you want 64MB card.

"These are great!  Many over the ear phones don't allow for much adjustment for head size, but these can accommodate a wider range than most.  In addition, each ear cup can swivel independently.  I've used them for many years now, primarily while running.  They fold up somewhat for storage.  I've owned several of them, and only once did one go bad--a wire going into the cups came loose.  Hours of sweat on the foam cups hasn't hurt them.  I can't speak about sound quality, because of all the noise I generate running and breathing gets in the way of fine discrimination.

"The Amazon page gives dimensions of the package. Here are some specifics regarding the product alone:15 oz: weight, not incuding cord, measured on my kitchen scales6.5 inches: Outside diameter of circular part2 inches or a little less: Height, with nothing plugged into itThe underside of the circular part is flat with six flat rubber legs/pads upon which it rests. Therefore, it does not slip on my granite countertop.Problem that this product solved: My kitchen and den are separated by a granite countertop, and on the den side my easy chair is backed right up to that countertop. I wanted sockets that could be accessed from either side, for cooking appliances (in the kitchen) or for plugging in my iPad or Kindle (while using them in the den). I can't imagine why an outlet wasn't thought of when my house was first built. I was going to call an electrician to add one, but this power strip seems to work just as well.How it solved my problem: The power strip does not budge or fall off the counter even when I am using the plugged in iPad. I could only make it slip off if I pulled it hard in a horizontal direction. The cord is long enough to reach the nearest wall outlet in the den. The price ($40+) seemed high a first, but getting an electrician out here would have cost a lot more.",5.0,B00000J4EY,1337040000,just what I needed
