though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout , BUT $T$ terrible .\n- Great food , great prices , great $T$ .\n- From the terrible $T$ , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .\n- This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer $T$ .\n- We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the $T$ was slow .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad $T$ , sometimes i get good good and bad service .\n- If presentation and $T$ is your thing , then this magic show works .\n- It 's super-trendy and there 's always someone to take that empty seat , so it seems that customer $T$ has been deemed not of the essence .\n- Good $T$ , great food , good value , and never have to wait in line !\n- The $T$ was very attentive and very generous .\n- Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for $T$ .\n- Nice ambiance , nice little bar , good bartender , Francois , and good $T$ .\n- I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the $T$ was rude an unattentive .\n- So , I paid a visit to $T$ at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .\n- Okay $T$ .\n- Finally , I got sick of the bad $T$ , obnoxious smirks , and snotty back talk .\n\n【グループB】\n- Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary $T$ to hold us over !\n- From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I ca n't remember because of the fabulous $T$ we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing .\n- $T$ is just so dang cool with this machine too .\n- My laptop now has no $T$ .\n- Try the $T$ , sizzling beef and couple it with coconut rice .\n- I was given a demonstration of $T$ .\n- For a savory take on the $T$ , try the hot and sour soup .\n- Who could n't love a DVD burner , 80-gigabyte $T$ , and fairly new graphics chip ? As I soon discovered , though , there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more : they use higher-quality components that are faster , better-configured , and end up lasting a lot longer .\n- It 's really also the service , is good and the $T$ are friendly .\n- $T$ are a delicious way to begin the meal .\n- We go on Mondays for the $T$ and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .\n- They have authentic Indian at amazin $T$ .\n- I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular $T$ , and the program will simply open that file .\n- I am used to computers with $T$ so I am having a little difficulty finding my way around .\n- the $T$ are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side .\n- My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of $T$ and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .\n- You rarely have to wait for a $T$ and the currys -LRB- masaman , green , red -RRB- are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it .\n- Innovations are just as assured , from the simple Carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the $T$ , beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce .\n- The ATI graphics card is a huge plus , definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older $T$ that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with , such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft .\n- The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the $T$ , as were the filling pasta mains .\n- The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good $T$ .\n- When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the $T$ crashed .\n- Additionally , there is barely a ventilation system in the computer , and even the simple activity of watching videos let alone $T$ causes the laptop to get very very hot , and in fact impossible to keep on lap .\n- Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy $T$ !\n- An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine $T$ - chef 's passion -LRB- and kitchen 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .\n- Actually , I had noticed the one on the sales floor also did n't have $T$ !\n- The $T$ is consistant and good but how it got name Best Diner In Manhattan is beyond me .\n- Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the $T$ , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .\n- they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small $T$ for our celebration .\n- They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the $T$ when you touched it .\n- But to be honest , I do n't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and $T$ and gaming .\n- The $T$ is pretty good too .\n- The $T$ covers a wide variety without being imposeing .\n- But with this laptop , the bass is very weak and the $T$ comes out sounding tinny .\n- If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the $T$ .\n- The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to $T$ , to escargot .\n- Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines $T$ like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .\n- The makhani was OK -- the $T$ was bland .\n- The menu consisted of standard $T$ , better then places like Balthazar etc. .\n- Of course , I also have several great software packages that came for free including $T$ , GarageBand , and iMovie .\n- The service is always great , and the $T$ walks around to make sure you enjoy .\n- When you want a piece of $T$ , head on over .\n- It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have $T$ and talk !\n- Everyone who works there -LRB- the host , the bartender , the $T$ -RRB- is so helpful .\n- I recommend the black roasted codfish , it was the best $T$ of the evening .\n- As for the $T$ , this is another bad idea .\n- We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional , $T$ , Windows Server Enterprise 2003 , and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise .\n- $T$ is a handy music-management program , and it is essential for anyone with an iPod .\n- But you must get the $T$ .\n- The Mini 's $T$ has n't changed since late 2010 - and for a good reason .\n- The portion sizes here are huge , and the $T$ is good .\n- From the erbazzone emiliana to the mostarda on the cheese plate , the $T$ at this restaurant are all handled with delicate care .\n- the $T$ does n't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on .\n- Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of $T$ problems .\n- The traditional Italian items are great - cheap and $T$ in a cozy setting .\n- however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the $T$ .\n- The $T$ is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .\n- Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off , after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the $T$ and where the heals of my hands sit , and the screen has a terrible glare .\n- And their $T$ are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !\n- The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a $T$ it must be the pumkin tortelini .\n- Why do people rave about the $T$ .\n- $T$ is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS !\n- The space is nice but when we order our $T$ we were in for a surprise .\n- Also , specify if you like your $T$ spicy -
