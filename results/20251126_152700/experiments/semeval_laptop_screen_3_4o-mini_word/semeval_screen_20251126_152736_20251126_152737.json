thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like ` bar ' or ' $T$ ' .\n- The appetizers are just OK and the $T$ were decidedly subpar .\n- Straight-forward , no surprises , very decent $T$ .\n- Butter was melted , $T$ warm , cheese oozing everywhere .\n- In terms of the food itself -- nothing special , we limited ourselves to several $T$ .\n- Only suggestion is that you skip the $T$ , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .\n- There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial $T$ in getting food at peak times .\n- Good $T$ , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .\n- I did n't complain , I liked the $T$ so much .\n- Then , get ripped on free $T$ .\n- Fresh veggies , all sorts of middle eastern spreads , cheese and falafel , soup , fish , rice , root vegetables , a rice medley , some spinach thing , lamb kebabs , $T$ ... soooo much fooood , and all of it delicious .\n- Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served $T$ we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served -LRB- and that order was undercooked -RRB- , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .\n- Lucky Strike is a great casual $T$ to just grab a bite to eat .\n- good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a $T$ .\n- The $T$ is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink .\n- The $T$ was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .\n- The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes , the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the $T$ useless .\n- My laptop with Windows 7 crashed and I did not want $T$ .\n- I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a $T$ where all you could taste was the lime .\n- The selection of food is excellent -LRB- I 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants -RRB- , and the $T$ is great .\n- Guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the $T$ that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .\n- They have very quick $T$ which is great when you do n't have much time .\n- Small $T$ for main entree , i had salmon -LRB- wasnt impressed -RRB- girlfriend had chicken , it was good .\n- The $T$ was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .\n- It took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 $T$ .\n- I went to $T$ and found some suggestions to fix it .\n- For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being $T$ .\n- Authentic food and they have REAL $T$ , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- I am replacing the $T$ with a Micron SSD soon .\n- all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately $T$ restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it .\n- Edible but really a ripoff at those $T$ given whats in the area .\n- The $T$ is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .\n- The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the $T$ or not .\n- Everyone who works there -LRB- the host , the bartender , the $T$ -RRB- is so helpful .\n- They 've the best $T$ and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .\n- It was like the $T$ forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool .\n- Average to good $T$ , but terrible delivery .\n- I am amazed by the poor reviews - I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian - great prices , great atmosphere , good $T$ and a wonderful wine list .\n- I loved the netbook -LRB- minus the fact that it was $T$ -RRB- until this started happening .\n- Call $T$ , standard email the form and fax it back in to us .\n- Authentic $T$ and they have REAL service , not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door .\n- We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the $T$ , and the food was delivered quickly , but we live only a few minutes walk from them .\n- Great food , great $T$ and awesome service .\n- Over $T$ , and small portions .\n- The overall $T$ was very very expensive , something I did expect .\n- Good $T$ at the right price , what more can you ask for .\n- The best $T$ , a chocolate and peanut butter tart , is n't particularly Hawaiian , but it 's a small world when it comes to sweets .\n- One more thing , this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC 's , also the $T$ are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables .\n- The $T$ is beyond horrible .\n- The $T$ are wonderfully low .\n- Be sure to try the Smoked Trout ... Lamb Chops , $T$ , Rabbit , the potato gratin , on and on and on ...\n- Clear $T$ on it and everything .\n- Further , this Mac Mini has a sloppy Bluetooth interface -LRB- courtesy of the $T$ -RRB- and the range is poor .\n- I had the best $T$ ever .\n- Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the $T$ was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .\n- The bread and lamb chops I had before the $T$ were quite good , however .\n- I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the $T$ and mother board yet again .\n- This bar has it all - great drinks , cool atmosphere , excellent $T$ and delicious food .\n- Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for $T$ / mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction .\n- However , there is just something so great about being outdoors , in great landscaping , enjoying a $T$ that makes going to this place worthwhile .\n- The service was attentive without being overbearing and each $T$ we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .\n- Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage -LRB- keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in -RRB- , buttons not working and $T$ inoperative .\n- I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed $T$ that were never very intuitive .\n- I looked around and based off my $T$ / features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .\n- This $T$ is terrific .\n- I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular $T$ , and the program will simply open that file .\n- It can not be the ambience , because the $T$ is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .\n- Turned out there was full $T$ upstairs and sat down .\n- After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties -LRB- multiples of 2 and higher -RRB- seated for 40 minutes , the three of us were squished into a small $T$ .\n- tried $T$ and hated it !!!\n- And it all comes at a very reasonable price -LRB- $T$ , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each -RRB- .\n- We were told that the $T$ was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call .\n- Great laptop that offers many great $T$ !\n- Do you think I purposely `` destroy '' my netbook , so that I can demand a new set ?
