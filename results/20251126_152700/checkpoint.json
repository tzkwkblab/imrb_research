Get used to it if you're sticking around.\n- I might be a prude. \"Suck him off in the bathroom of your friend's home!\" Those don't equate\n- money always talk. i want more to learn from this lesson.\n- would whip out meat scepter, but unironically\n- Oh no! Poor dude!\n- Yes I heard abt the f bombs! That has to be why. Thanks for your reply:) until then hubby and I will anxiously wait 😝\n- as someone who dealt with a burn out/mental break down 4 years ago, /s/ this post makes me feel very optimistic about the future /s/\n- Ohh, whoops. I still don’t agree but I see my mistake \n- I know you'd think we lost to Arbroath the way folk are going on.\n- She had it saved on her phone because she was too lazy to delete it. Thank goodness.\n- I think that was [NAME], but I'll see if I can confirm that.\n- No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.\n- Utah roads are definitely some of the best out there. Anywhere else I have lived has had either similar or worse, or waaaay waaaay worse\n- No, I’m saying that “not getting an abortion” is the default option, and takes less deliberate effort than getting an abortion.\n- >a water molecule spends around 600 years in Lake Superior. I guess it takes a while lol\n- Is it weird that my first thought was \"at least it's not a Minion?\" \n- *sigh* just take it ⬆️\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

It's shitty of them not to ask though. \n- Next level up to termination.\n- Good job [NAME]!\n- I fucking love New Years day with the Hawks playing in the Winter Classic\n- China is imperialist, but having private industry and poor-working conditions doesn’t make it imperialist.\n- She just needs to kiss [NAME]\n- I think you have a terrible opinion. Now that we agree on something though this could be the start of a beautiful friendship!\n- Hell yeah buddy things are looking up.\n- Game day activities would be my guess. Not positive though.\n- Which three of you motherfuckers changed it from 666 upvotes when I clicked on this post?\n- This sounds very familiar...\n- I live next door to this, and I was up late....

Good luck finding spiritual success outside of a community of other people.\n- It’s pretty clear UBI is not going to actually Make the character interesting. We should stop deluding ourselves.\n- Dummy I'm disagreeing with you\n- Enter trier [NAME] isn’t a starting level pg he’s better off in the g league playing 30+mpg every game with a big role\n- When are you and dad going to pop out a few baby-mammas for us boys, huh? And that's the *less* disgusting alternative. Blech!\n- I'm 25 and I still don't have a license. I'm terrified of driving and get anxiety every time I'm behind the wheel.\n- Me too. It’s my favorite. His cadence in saying it is so perfect lol.\n- I have and it didn't help. It's only a matter of time now for how long I can hold on.\n- Their interests are convergent where it matters: they *all* want more of your money to go to healthcare.\n- That sucks :( are you guys still in good terms though?\n- #LET'S NOT BRING UP THAT PORTION OF THAT DAY.\n- snitches get stitches\n- Happy Daily Peko #270! Source couldn’t be found I think it’s from the manga.\n- That's a giant, adorable, super-good woofer you got right there!\n- my sentiment exactly\n- Now that's a frozen dessert I haven't eaten in a long time.. a long time.\n- No I am still friends with the person I value his friendship he can just be...judgy?\n- [NAME], [NAME] and [NAME] could see that they were tipped off. \n- Maybe not harassment in this tweet in particular, but there are difinitely some fans who are still pressed about eliminations and are not afraid to let the queens know\n- My husband and I have been circling the drain for years. :(\n- It's also ridiculously removed from reality. Dying to a disease or injury from an accident is orders of magnitude more likely than getting shot.\n- Bless your dog!\n- Yo that guys hot what's his reddit\n- Thanks and you too!\n- That kid has the face of a douchebag\n- Oh [NAME] you idiot\n- Thanks, that's an important point I should have mentioned. \n- I don’t like it.\n- Mushroom is the most objective recounter we have, he makes pretty clear [NAME] preferred fucking around in flea bottom over any sort of responsibility.\n- Wow, that crazy. Hope this doesn't happen again with you. Stay safe!\n- Get you some!!\n- Heart races everytime I get a match. Oddly enough I don't feel that at all playing offline with my friends.\n- Hope the best for him\n- I'm at work right now and its going to start snowing before I leave. I drive an MR2. Thoughts and prayers please.\n- Great cover of my favorite song. I loved watching you slowly giving into the temptation to rock out to the rhythm.\n- Where is he spewing hate? I follow him on twitter and have never seen him say anything hateful unless you consider criticism of [RELIGION] hateful.\n- Haha! I remember seeing this when it aired\n- Cheers, I have some cheese left in the fridge that I can use here, thanks for the info.\n- Damn, I was really hoping for some comeuppance at the end, but at least you no longer have her for a boss, so silver lining.\n- No, just act surprised if anything comes of it. \n- Funny they decided to show a bunch of T2 images demonstrating the chronic microvascular ischemic disease and omitted the diffusion which had the more interesting findings pertinent to TGA.\n- Why cinnamon powder instead of bark?\n- Oh, a crow... Doh!\n- I want a shirt that says \"Brilliant, Beautiful, Ferocious, Thing\". That's power.\n- I just got banned from one of his subreddits, I haven't been this excited for a ban since the snap from /r/thanosdidnothingwrong!\n- I looked this person up. She’s a real doctor\n- Thousands of people born every single day! But mine? Mine's a god damned miracle!\n- She did, but she forgot she had them in her bag.\n- Looks like Jack the cat with the super deep meow.\n- No that was my cyst that got removed today lol\n- Is that Riverside, CA?

Haha!\n- Omg I just finished and I'm in awe...\n- It's not much what you say but how you say it and the tone you use, children absorb more the emotion rather than the logic behind it\n- > no child should go without needed medical care.

There are plenty of [RELIGION] people that are cool with whatever you're babbling about\n- It's great you have a friend with the same struggles as long as you both encourage each other to do better. It can be very comforting.\n- Ahaha alright. Im done. Peace man good luck with everything :)\n- If you're going out with a big group then this doesn't seem so bad.

The question is what happens next for people that are obsolete.\n- Lol hows that different then [NAME]\n- Oh yah for sure, I am on that page dude. I thought that’s what you meant.\n- You are my beer god thank you haha\n- Oh I didn’t realize you were saying that, my bad . And yes that’s a great idea that would help develop him \n- By not using Facebook as a barometer of success. Look at Facebook as a highlight reel and not what people are actually living,\n- You.

Its an easy boogeyman.\n- For be just being a handsome guy works wonders.\n- Same. Even while not on my period I have lower back pain\n- True true. I concede.\n- Omg at this rate he's gonna be in the next smash bros\n- Honestly, I have a hard time sleeping in socks.
