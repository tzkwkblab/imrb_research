      "The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.",

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",
      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.",
      "Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.",

You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.",
      "Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.",
      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.",
      "RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n",
      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",

      "[h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game.

      "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",

      "I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.",
      "I don't think this was a very good game, at least for adults on PC.  And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.  I like the idea of a creative LEGO diorama game, with slow and creative oriented gameplay.  As this one is though, I would only recommend it to a pre-teen LEGO fan with a lot of patience., or someone heavily medicated.\n",
      "Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3",
      "I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.",
      "I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.",
      "Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n",

The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",

      "Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.",

      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless.

I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10",
      "[i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points.

But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game.

      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",
      "Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]",

      "owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??",
      "Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.",

      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",
      "Over 240 hours, 1500+ runs, I've completed this game a measely 12 times. This is one of the most difficult games I've ever played. The seconds are minutes and minutes are hours when you're playing this game.  I've been to Hell once and I only just recently finished it under 8 minutes. This game hasn't gotten stale yet but it will make you feel every emotion ten fold.\n\nUPDATE after 519 hours of gameplay. I have unlocked all of the achievements, even  the dreaded \"no gold\" one. I have completed this game countless times now, yet I still can't understate how difficult this game is. The hours I have spent in this game were well spent and for the price you're getting it for it's a steal....just don't steal from the shopkeeper.\n\nAnd to the people complaining it is too hard, Spelunky is meant to be difficult, that's the challenge and the point of it.",
      "Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.",
      "Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody?

The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love.

      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
      "Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n",
      "imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.",
      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there.

      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",

      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",
      "Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n",
      "In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.",
      "When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it.

I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time.

Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is.

      "I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K.

      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",

This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .",
      "12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.",
      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",

      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",

Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",
      "Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",
      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)",

Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one.

      "When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!",
      "It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations.

If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.",

      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",

In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.",
      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",

      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.",
      "Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game.

      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",

      "You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10",
      "Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"",

      "Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n",

      "Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!",
      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",
      "Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.",
      "Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN",
      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.",
      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)",
      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

      "The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.",
      "NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.",
      "Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.",
      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",
      "Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.",
      "[h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!",
      "Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.",
      "Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!",
      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",
      "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",
      "What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.",
      "If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.",
      "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",
      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",
      "A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.",
      "This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free",
      "It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.",
      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",
      "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.",

      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",
      "Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.",

      "This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!",
      "Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .",
      "Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it",
      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",
      "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth.

      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",
      "From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",

I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.",
      "I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts.

I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws.

      "The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.",

      "The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator.

      "This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)",

      "Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.",

      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",
      "I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.

It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",

Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate.

      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.",
      "It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar.

      "I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^",
      "Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love..."

Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- [h1]A True Classic[/h1] \n[u]scroll down for my general consensus[/u]\n\n[b]===[ Audience ]===  [/b]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n [b]===[ Graphics ]===  [/b]\n☐ Potato\n☐ Terrible\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Drop Dead Gorgeous\n☐ Real life\n\n[b]===[ Price/Quality ]===  [/b]\n☑ Full price \n☐ Wait for sale \n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n[b]===[ Requirements ]===  [/b]\n☑ 00's PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n[b]===[ Difficulty ]=== [/b]\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Too easy\n☐ Easy\n☑ Medium\n☐ Hard\n☐ Dark Souls\n☐ Battletoads\n\n [b]===[ Game time/length ]=== [/b]\n☐ Really short\n☐ Short \n☐ Few hours\n☑Normal Runtime (clocking at 15h)\n☐ Long (about 30[i]ish[/i] hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n[b]===[ Blood/Gore ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☑ Only blood\n☐ Blood and some Graphic Violence but not something extreme\n\n[b]===[ Violence ]=== [/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Mild\n☑ Average\n☐ Violent\n☐ Manhunt\n☐ Mortal Kombat\n\n[b]===[ Soundtrack ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Annoying\n☐ Better than Despacito\n☐ Good\n☑ Cool and very creative\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n[b]===[ Story ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Better than Twilight\n☐ OK (more on that below)\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[b]===[ Bugs ]===  [/b]\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Many bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ No bugs\n\n[b]===[ Others ]=== \nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound Design: 8.5/10 ( I didn't like the sound mixing)\nOverall: 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]A true classic. [/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- B4B - 59.99 euro. You recieve:\nBad AI, bad animations, online only*, no mod support, no varying sound cues, music where??, characters with zero personality, tacked on weapon modding with guns that all feel the same, no environmental physics, unfair director (spawning 40 tallboys at start of map)\n(*otherwise no progression)\n\nL4D1 & 2 - 8.19 euro each (often on sale for 1.99-2.99 each). You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- Gorgeous graphics + 80s/90s anime artstyle + Spooky + Atmospheric + You're a lesbian. What more could you want.\n\nPS: play Pocket Mirror <3\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- I don't think this was a very good game, at least for adults on PC.  And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.  I like the idea of a creative LEGO diorama game, with slow and creative oriented gameplay.  As this one is though, I would only recommend it to a pre-teen LEGO fan with a lot of patience., or someone heavily medicated.\n\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- User agreements are so scummy, I read them and I would sooner pirate this game than play it for free. IM GOING TO DO SOMETHING I CANNOT UNDO IF THIS SHIT DOENST STOP SOON.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- [i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points. Points unlock ‘upgrades’ for your plague. The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!\n- I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n- + Great developer support. Updated quite frequently\n+ Great graphics for its game engine\n+ Great vehicle physics\n+ Dynamic time, weather and vehicle damage.\n+ Friendly interface\n+ Ability to purchase garages and hire drivers to work for you\n+ 1000s of miles of road to drive on\n+ Many cities to discover\n+ Several trucks to choose from\n+ Realistic sounds\n+ Lots of accessories and options to choose\n+ Great wheel support\n+ Many trailers and jobs to choose\n+ Multiplayer available\n+ Integrated radio and music player\n+ Console can be enabled to edit / modify different parameters\n+ Map editor\n+ Inexpensive DLC\n+ Easily the best truck simulator out there\n- Imbalanced, stupid 4+ v 1 situations which aren't in your favour, buggy hitboxes (e.g some blocks won't work), skill biased: You will be killed so many times before for you will get remotley good. But there is no way you can get better when Sir Rapealot who is level 50, who dominates your team, one hit stabs you everytime. \n\nHowever, this is a blast with friends. But it takes alot of convincing to get everyone to play this game because of the things I previously stated. \n\nThis game is completley based on skill which you cannot obtain without 8+ hours of death, death and death. \n\n****** DEFINITLEY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE ******\n- I have waited for this game for over a year, played the demo and realized it was even better. the only reason i haven't played more is because i'm about to pass out. \n\nthe game is a delightful visual and musical experience, setting the vibe really well, and the characters feel full of life. the main cast at least, with the amount of animations from swimming, attacking, climbing, fishing... there was a lot of love put into this.\n\nand if you aren't good at the game, or just want an easier time, theres easy tweaking your experience with relics. by the time i got to the earth wizard town, i could effectively triple my survivability and ensure a follow up. so if it looks interesting i encourage you to pick it up!\n\nan edit: 20 hours later. the game still has so much more, and it isn't afraid to deal with some stuff. this game isn't light fluff, but it's worth it\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- Over 240 hours, 1500+ runs, I've completed this game a measely 12 times. This is one of the most difficult games I've ever played. The seconds are minutes and minutes are hours when you're playing this game.  I've been to Hell once and I only just recently finished it under 8 minutes. This game hasn't gotten stale yet but it will make you feel every emotion ten fold.\n\nUPDATE after 519 hours of gameplay. I have unlocked all of the achievements, even  the dreaded \"no gold\" one. I have completed this game countless times now, yet I still can't understate how difficult this game is. The hours I have spent in this game were well spent and for the price you're getting it for it's a steal....just don't steal from the shopkeeper.\n\nAnd to the people complaining it is too hard, Spelunky is meant to be difficult, that's the challenge and the point of it.\n- Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.\n- Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Y'all couldn't let her have a happy ending, but you could have at least let the poor little baby keep Comrade Mitten. Reality is, war has no good side, no true enemy, just innocents who die and suffer. Maybe Aysa's future is brighter there, after everything. :(\n\nWhat a sad journey with a sad conclusion, but it was a great little story nonetheless.\n- Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands. Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro?

Ex Pe-P-Pee? \n\n[code]Niche, obscure and underrated games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.\n- When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- Take Dota2, HoN or LoL. Strip away all the farming, item buying, running around and randomness. \nThat leaves you with pure fast paced battles in an arena. \nNo random effects, just skill based combat with WASD controls and mouse aiming.\nThat's Battlerite.\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..\n- Not super fan, but old timer Battlefield player here, since Battlefield 2/BF2142/Bad Company 1/2/Battlefield 3 (LAST ONE)\n\n\nPros:\nThe Multiplayer is addictive and still fun to this day.\nThe visuals are great in multiplayer.\n\nCons:\nThe UI.\nThe Campaign is literal trash.\nCampaign AI is trash.\n2013 Campaign visuals are really bad, worse than the multiplayer.\nThe story is trash, annoying black guy, constant preaching, and DICE simping over an Asian Chinese woman.\n\n\"Glad that 2042 will not include a campaign, I m happy with Bots.\"\n2/8/2022 - Oh boy.... Nvm about 2042.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n\n【グループB】\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- It's CSS.  Nothing fancy about it. Old graphics, slow gameplay, and nothing really to play for except for skins to sell.  I'll stick with Battlefield series.\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- horrible very very very very bad bad grafics fps and game play \nbut if you can play the game better do it i can watch jacksepticeye play it\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- I find it hard to describe everything I read, I’m not even the person who usually reviews games in a serious way because of my difficulty in expressing my emotion, however, I felt the need to externalize what I felt in a simple and fast way. \n\nWhat I read is not a game neither a visual novel, it's a story of a life... Everything that’s happened in this story has stolen my heart, there have been so many beautiful moments that will be impossible to forget... \nI found myself crying over tragedies that weren’t mine.\n\nThanks NOVECT for this masterpiece full of love.\n- Game slaps, played the first area, unlocked ranked and spent 4 hours grinding a 2 minuet long level to reach the top rank in bronze 1 division and i'm going to do it again tomorrow\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- the game would've been better if Leon moaned more tbh...\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- Why aren't more people playing this? Charming and challenging, and a perfect game for the Steam Deck.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way.

This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix Curator [/url][/b]\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- [h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- most overrated game to ever plague the front page of steam\n- Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- if you're looking to experience the greatest time travel drama ever made then I really recommend giving it a chance because there is a lot to love here. Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate. If you've only watched the anime, this is worth checking out for the additional endings and science themes.\n\nSteins;Gate Elite is a new way to discover the classic story, fusing the anime with the visual novel. El Psy Kongroo, 10/10\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^\n- Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- [h1]A True Classic[/h1] \n[u]scroll down for my general consensus[/u]\n\n[b]===[ Audience ]===  [/b]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n [b]===[ Graphics ]===  [/b]\n☐ Potato\n☐ Terrible\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Drop Dead Gorgeous\n☐ Real life\n\n[b]===[ Price/Quality ]===  [/b]\n☑ Full price \n☐ Wait for sale \n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n[b]===[ Requirements ]===  [/b]\n☑ 00's PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n[b]===[ Difficulty ]=== [/b]\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Too easy\n☐ Easy\n☑ Medium\n☐ Hard\n☐ Dark Souls\n☐ Battletoads\n\n [b]===[ Game time/length ]=== [/b]\n☐ Really short\n☐ Short \n☐ Few hours\n☑Normal Runtime (clocking at 15h)\n☐ Long (about 30[i]ish[/i] hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n[b]===[ Blood/Gore ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☑ Only blood\n☐ Blood and some Graphic Violence but not something extreme\n\n[b]===[ Violence ]=== [/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Mild\n☑ Average\n☐ Violent\n☐ Manhunt\n☐ Mortal Kombat\n\n[b]===[ Soundtrack ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Annoying\n☐ Better than Despacito\n☐ Good\n☑ Cool and very creative\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n[b]===[ Story ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Better than Twilight\n☐ OK (more on that below)\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[b]===[ Bugs ]===  [/b]\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Many bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ No bugs\n\n[b]===[ Others ]=== \nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound Design: 8.5/10 ( I didn't like the sound mixing)\nOverall: 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]A true classic. [/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- B4B - 59.99 euro. You recieve:\nBad AI, bad animations, online only*, no mod support, no varying sound cues, music where??, characters with zero personality, tacked on weapon modding with guns that all feel the same, no environmental physics, unfair director (spawning 40 tallboys at start of map)\n(*otherwise no progression)\n\nL4D1 & 2 - 8.19 euro each (often on sale for 1.99-2.99 each). You recieve:\nGreat companion & enemy AI, memorable dialogue (I hate hospitals, grabbing pills), motion capture, great music & cues, overwhelming mod support, all weapons have a purpose and vary nicely, incredibly memorable characters, actually good director, etc etc.\n\nObvious choice.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- Gorgeous graphics + 80s/90s anime artstyle + Spooky + Atmospheric + You're a lesbian. What more could you want.\n\nPS: play Pocket Mirror <3\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- I don't think this was a very good game, at least for adults on PC.  And that's fine.  This is a kids game better suited to playing on a Switch.  And I give it credit for not being a direct clone of another game just LEGO skinned.\n\nI do criticize the lack of real functionality of the creative bits.  Functionally every building moment was just making a bridge from point A to B.  Even the two vehicles it let you build functioned as a cut scene bridge to another tile. \n\nThe 5 worlds are split up into smaller sections, presumably to run on handheld consoles.  And the controls are with that in mind too.  You can't mouse look, you have to pause and then you can move the camera around.\n\nA few of the building parts caused the game to crash or the character to be stuck, however there is a button in the options menu that says \"help I'm stuck\" and it was pretty good about getting the character unstuck.  If they didn't add that there were 3 points in the game where I would have not been able to proceed.\n\nI hope that there will be a better version of this game made sometime.  I like the idea of a creative LEGO diorama game, with slow and creative oriented gameplay.  As this one is though, I would only recommend it to a pre-teen LEGO fan with a lot of patience., or someone heavily medicated.\n\n- Luzia reminds me of a little me and the banter between the characters is very cute. \nThis game gives me big Spirited Away vibes but even after I finished it I am still lowkey confused who is who and what what whats've? \nThere were many touching moments [spoiler]esp the scene where Luzia said \"I can't save you but I can help you\" it struck me pretty hard because I always question whether or not one has the right to take their own life, and who are we to stop them...[/spoiler] Overall I actually feel this game is wholesome. It can teach one about what depression is like if you've never experienced it.\nI only got jumpscared once but it was a pleasant experience even then :3\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- Two main things first up: -\n\n1)  The advertising is wrong.  This is isometric 3D for nearly the whole game, not 2D.\n2)  Do have an X-Box controller if you buy this game.  The game is far more difficult and less enjoyable if you don't.\n\n   The game shows you don't need a complex plot to make a great game.  Evil Wizard has attacked castle and kidnapped four princesses.  Your job (and that of up to three of your mates) is to go out there, beat up the bad guys, and rescue the princesses.  The game is effectively \"Double Dragon Medieval\".  You don't get to use the scenery as weapons but you do have archery, magic, fast or heavy melee options, jumping, attacks combos, different weapons, and pets that give you bonuses.  The game is reasonably fast paced - two to three massed minion attacks, mini boss, two to three more massed minion attacks, big boss.\n\n    The key game mechanic is experience points with which you can build strength (melee attacks do more damage), power (magic does more damage and recharges quicker), defence (enemy attacks do less damage), and speed (move quicker and srchery does more damage).  This means the more you play, the tougher your character gets, and the easier the enemies become.  It's quite fun playing from the start with high level characters who easily demolish the starting opposition.\n\n   The game's graphics are bright and colourful, the different soundtracks for each stage are bouncy and fun.  The enemies change regularly so the games doesn't become too monotonous but there are few foes that cannot be beaten with melee combos and dodge (that said there are a small number of mini bosses and big bosses from whom you need to keep your distance and a decent magic attack becomes essential).\n\n    Any negatives ?\n\n    1) The dev's humour is basic and scatological.  If you have a strong aversion to poo jokes this will be a negative.\n    2)  Minor spoiler - Some of the bad guys look like angry golliwogs.  Coupled with the knights' outfits that aren't too dissimilar  from the KKK this has caused accusations of racism.  Of course the KKK costumes are reminiscent of medieval knights which is the more likely inspiration for the game.  One of the princesses is definitely black.  Personally I'm not sure.  Compared with \"Birth of a Nation\" the game is \"Sesame Street\" but only an idiot wouldn't have recognised that someone would have been upset by the imagery.  Personally I can live with it and still enjoy it as a medieval Double Dragon but I give you warning in case you won't.\n\nS.x.\n\n\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- User agreements are so scummy, I read them and I would sooner pirate this game than play it for free. IM GOING TO DO SOMETHING I CANNOT UNDO IF THIS SHIT DOENST STOP SOON.\n- 1. Mea Culpa > Ruego Al Alba\n2. combat feels much better\n3. oops no instakill traps\n4. [strike]bleeding crown prayer is too strong[/strike] wtf, just got the time stop prayer\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- [i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points. Points unlock ‘upgrades’ for your plague. The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- Having accumulated over 13400 hours in-game with [i]Arma 3[/i], I would certainly recommend it to others. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!\n- I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]\n- Not saying this as a tough guy thing or anything, But it is difficult for me to shed actual tears.\n\nThis game made me ugly cry twice, and happy cry once.\n\nThis not a story about zombies.\n\nIt is about a little girl growing up in the worst possible situation.\n\nAnd what she makes of it.\n\n2/13/2023 finished\n\nPS: If I ever have a daughter I will name her Clementine. This is the tier of impact this game had on me we are talking about.\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.\n- + Great developer support. Updated quite frequently\n+ Great graphics for its game engine\n+ Great vehicle physics\n+ Dynamic time, weather and vehicle damage.\n+ Friendly interface\n+ Ability to purchase garages and hire drivers to work for you\n+ 1000s of miles of road to drive on\n+ Many cities to discover\n+ Several trucks to choose from\n+ Realistic sounds\n+ Lots of accessories and options to choose\n+ Great wheel support\n+ Many trailers and jobs to choose\n+ Multiplayer available\n+ Integrated radio and music player\n+ Console can be enabled to edit / modify different parameters\n+ Map editor\n+ Inexpensive DLC\n+ Easily the best truck simulator out there\n- Imbalanced, stupid 4+ v 1 situations which aren't in your favour, buggy hitboxes (e.g some blocks won't work), skill biased: You will be killed so many times before for you will get remotley good. But there is no way you can get better when Sir Rapealot who is level 50, who dominates your team, one hit stabs you everytime. \n\nHowever, this is a blast with friends. But it takes alot of convincing to get everyone to play this game because of the things I previously stated. \n\nThis game is completley based on skill which you cannot obtain without 8+ hours of death, death and death. \n\n****** DEFINITLEY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE ******\n- I have waited for this game for over a year, played the demo and realized it was even better. the only reason i haven't played more is because i'm about to pass out. \n\nthe game is a delightful visual and musical experience, setting the vibe really well, and the characters feel full of life. the main cast at least, with the amount of animations from swimming, attacking, climbing, fishing... there was a lot of love put into this.\n\nand if you aren't good at the game, or just want an easier time, theres easy tweaking your experience with relics. by the time i got to the earth wizard town, i could effectively triple my survivability and ensure a follow up. so if it looks interesting i encourage you to pick it up!\n\nan edit: 20 hours later. the game still has so much more, and it isn't afraid to deal with some stuff. this game isn't light fluff, but it's worth it\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- Over 240 hours, 1500+ runs, I've completed this game a measely 12 times. This is one of the most difficult games I've ever played. The seconds are minutes and minutes are hours when you're playing this game.  I've been to Hell once and I only just recently finished it under 8 minutes. This game hasn't gotten stale yet but it will make you feel every emotion ten fold.\n\nUPDATE after 519 hours of gameplay. I have unlocked all of the achievements, even  the dreaded \"no gold\" one. I have completed this game countless times now, yet I still can't understate how difficult this game is. The hours I have spent in this game were well spent and for the price you're getting it for it's a steal....just don't steal from the shopkeeper.\n\nAnd to the people complaining it is too hard, Spelunky is meant to be difficult, that's the challenge and the point of it.\n- Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.\n- Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.  Not a bad game by any means, has the same charm as the original S.K., but why pay for it here if you can get it free with the original (now called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove).\n\n- 69 % of your time you spend walking around the forest, \nblowing in the animal whistle without actually seeing any animals\n\n10 % of your time you spend carefully approaching the animals you have spotted in the far far away distance\n\n1 % of your time you spend aiming, fireing your gun and missing all the significant organs of the animals\n\nThe last 20 % of your time you spend running after the animals you have wounded without ever seeing them again\n\nMost realistic hunting experience ever\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- RIP Johnny Gat and your whole 2 minutes of screentime.\nWhile being a good sandbox game on its own merits, SR3 does NOT improve upon SR2 in very many aspects. In fact, they actually removed a lot of content from the previous game, though it's not like most people probably played that.\nGone are choosing more than one type of shirt to wear, or belts. You can no longer use your phone to dial numbers, or call taxis to transport you or ambulances to heal you. They removed a lot of activities as well as a lot of really cool things the other games had. So many, in fact, that I could probably spend a whole paragraph just listing them.\nThis is for a large part subjective, but the gangs in this game are very unimpressive by Saints Row standards. It comes down mostly to character writing, but the characterization on each faction is not good; motivations are usually left vague and most characters introduced besides the replacement Saints members are left undefined with little personality.\nThe game is extremely buggy (compared to the others in the series, although it's not quite Bethesda level) and the netcode is pretty bad too. Playing co-op is often pretty difficult because most actions done by both players will be out of sync with each other.\nAlso, it isn't a well-optimized port for PC. The graphics are sub-par for the most part, but the game still runs like garbage most of the time. Sub-60 FPS on high unless you're playing on a top-of-the-line system (by 2011 standards).\nOh, and one time I switched to one of the radio stations and was given a 2 minute long lecture by the DJ about how I'm \"wasting my life pressing buttons in a murder simulator\" and how I should \"go out and get a girlfriend or something.\" Game just killed itself on anything immersion related for breaking the fourth wall and trying to antagonize me for playing a video game. Ironically enough.\nThanks Volition.\nMost of the DLC in this game is low-quality and overpriced, and most of them except for the mission packs are already on the disk, by the way.\nThe co-op is cool is you have someone to play it with.\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:\n\n1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags\n2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.  \n\nAs such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.\n\n Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.\n\nI'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.\n\nIf you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.\n\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Y'all couldn't let her have a happy ending, but you could have at least let the poor little baby keep Comrade Mitten. Reality is, war has no good side, no true enemy, just innocents who die and suffer. Maybe Aysa's future is brighter there, after everything. :(\n\nWhat a sad journey with a sad conclusion, but it was a great little story nonetheless.\n- Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands. Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro?

Ex Pe-P-Pee? \n\n[code]Niche, obscure and underrated games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.\n- When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n\n- Two words: Modding Heaven. This is probably one of the most modular games I've ever played. \n\nYou wanna play Mount and Blade in a historical time period instead of Calradia? OK, which one? Don't answer, it doesn't matter, there's probably a mod for it. \n\nWanna add in some magic and play in a fantasy universe? There's mods for that. \n\nHow about a game set in the modern day? Or in a sci-fi universe? Or a post-apocalypse wasteland? Or the Wild West? Or maybe something specific like throwing your hat into the Game of Thrones, or defending the World of Men in Lord of the Rings, or taking over the Empire from Star Wars?\n\nPerhaps you'd like to set sail on the seven seas as a pirate in a nautical adventu-! Oh, wait, OK, there aren't any of -those-. \n\n...but there's mods for all of the others, with even more being made every day! \n\n\nI guarantee, if you buy this and are open to modding your game, you will never go another year without playing Warband. Maybe a week, maybe a few months-- but just when you think you're done with it, you'll find another mod based on your favorite movie series popping up to pull you back in. \n\nIt is worth well above whatever you'll pay for it.\n\n\n- I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- Take Dota2, HoN or LoL. Strip away all the farming, item buying, running around and randomness. \nThat leaves you with pure fast paced battles in an arena. \nNo random effects, just skill based combat with WASD controls and mouse aiming.\nThat's Battlerite.\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..\n- Not super fan, but old timer Battlefield player here, since Battlefield 2/BF2142/Bad Company 1/2/Battlefield 3 (LAST ONE)\n\n\nPros:\nThe Multiplayer is addictive and still fun to this day.\nThe visuals are great in multiplayer.\n\nCons:\nThe UI.\nThe Campaign is literal trash.\nCampaign AI is trash.\n2013 Campaign visuals are really bad, worse than the multiplayer.\nThe story is trash, annoying black guy, constant preaching, and DICE simping over an Asian Chinese woman.\n\n\"Glad that 2042 will not include a campaign, I m happy with Bots.\"\n2/8/2022 - Oh boy.... Nvm about 2042.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n\n【グループB】\n- When I show new games to one of my friends she always asks if it is possible to pee in the game and sadly I usually must tell her that it isnt possible because there is so few games where this special detail is being paid attention to. But this here my dude! I tried to show her the game yesterday so I got her setup on the valve index and start the game all good, but we couldn’t move at all... We tried everything! We tried physically move in our vr room to see the boards that had text written on them because we spawned behind them which I found a little weird as well. On the board it said eat the hamburger to start the game or eat the poo to guit. I saw a box on the street and I remembered by seeing the trailer there was a box where inside there was a burger so immediately we worked hard to try and reach the burger so we could start the game. It was too far away for us to try and actually in real life walk to it so we had to just accept defeat. She didn’t get to see her first vr game where it would be possible to urinate. I saw a update post a few minutes ago where you were saying something about movemnet in the game that you have to grip and throw arms around or something? This I guess we didn’t try since usually moving is one of the triggers to teleport or just the stick like in any controller. Today we will try again and hopefully succeed in our task to urinate in a vr game! You could be making history today my friend. And for all the bad reviews for this game I want to just say a couple things: cmon dude. Its one guy whos making this game! It is cheap and early access... those already tell you a lot about the game and you should not expect a triple a title and the experience of the century. I went through a video game making school or whatever which took 3 years so it was not 2 weeks online course I just quit after the first week so I actually know a lot what it takes to make games and with this I can tell there has been some hours used to it, but again it’s only one dude. My game didn’t work either, but it might have been because we didn’t know how to play. I’m not complaining for 4 dollars, I’m not a hobo ;)\n\nEDIT: And there it is! A day after my review and a 170mb update with new features and a fix for not been able to play at all :) I wasn't able to walk earlier either, but I suppose yo may not be able to in the \"mainmenu\". Gotta go try the update once my friend visits again!\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- It's CSS.  Nothing fancy about it. Old graphics, slow gameplay, and nothing really to play for except for skins to sell.  I'll stick with Battlefield series.\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- horrible very very very very bad bad grafics fps and game play \nbut if you can play the game better do it i can watch jacksepticeye play it\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- Amazing game that I love to play, but the boyfriend that I was playing it with broke up with me a few days after playing this game. A game that's about fixing your relationship.\n10/10 game.\n0/10 in my heart.\n\nedit: why do people find this funny i wasn't kidding\n\nEdit # 2: It has been 7 months since I had originally played this game. What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- I find it hard to describe everything I read, I’m not even the person who usually reviews games in a serious way because of my difficulty in expressing my emotion, however, I felt the need to externalize what I felt in a simple and fast way. \n\nWhat I read is not a game neither a visual novel, it's a story of a life... Everything that’s happened in this story has stolen my heart, there have been so many beautiful moments that will be impossible to forget... \nI found myself crying over tragedies that weren’t mine.\n\nThanks NOVECT for this masterpiece full of love.\n- Game slaps, played the first area, unlocked ranked and spent 4 hours grinding a 2 minuet long level to reach the top rank in bronze 1 division and i'm going to do it again tomorrow\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- the game would've been better if Leon moaned more tbh...\n- Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- Why aren't more people playing this? Charming and challenging, and a perfect game for the Steam Deck.\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- [b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish. Great set pieces, great small stories, and just  great writing overall.\n[*] All characters are people that you want to run into again, having unique stories and good jokes.\n[*] Story elements feel earned despite upbeat nature. Protagonist has reason to be upbeat, but does face hardship.\n[*] Miriam's character is the best and shines as the secondary protagonist.\n[*] The club scene. Just. All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix Curator [/url][/b]\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- [h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.\n- If you are looking for a game that you can never master, here is the game for you.\n- Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it\n- [h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- From afar, the life of royalty can seem very glamorous: the lavish lifestyle, the royal finery, fancy food and drink. However, the life of a prince can be very difficult and traumatic, when your very birth was a disappointment to the king. \n\nUGLY is the fragmented story of a prince who was considered by his father, the king, to be much too ugly to show his face. Forced to wear a mask and bear his father’s unfair demands, we wake up amongst the ruins of what must have been a rather fantastic palace. \n\nThe main mechanic in UGLY is the magical mirror that the prince receives at the beginning. This mirror allows him to create a reflection of himself within the space that you can switch between. You can place the mirror either vertically or horizontally, allowing you to enter rooms that may be blocked by impassable walls, or reaching platforms high up in hard to reach areas.\n\nThere are several different areas, each locked by a door with a particular coloured gemstone. To progress you must find the special key for each door, and inside clear out all of the rooms by, again, finding keys and unlocking every door. Once you’ve cleared an area, and collected the next coloured-gemstone-key, you will be confronted with that area’s boss. \n\nThe boss battles are extremely fun, and are like a much more intensified puzzle than a “fight”. Some of the puzzle rooms are real mind bogglers, and it will take all of your ingenuity to flip the switch in your brain to maximize the mechanics and figure out all of the puzzles. Each room is different and challenging, and the background design is chalk full of visual storytelling. \n\nFrom drawings and pictures on walls, to very interesting machines, to a whole theatre room where you can tell the little prince used to put on puppet shows for his loving mother and all of his stuffed animals.  The story is a treatise to what can happen to a child who’s tenderness and creativity is stifled by the unseemly and unreasonable demands of a narcissistic parent. The wonderful part is that the story is left up to the player to figure out. \n\nThere are secrets to uncover: hidden films and the prince’s memories to unlock. Every subsequent area adds a new mechanic to work with, or around, to the puzzling (such as pink pant that doesn’t allow you to switch to your reflection, or broken glass that your reflection can actually touch). \n\nThe game is very reminiscent of Braid, and considering how mind-blowing and phenomenal that game was when it was originally released in 2008, it’s fantastic to see another game following in those creative footsteps and create such a stellar experience for gamers everywhere. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle games, a challenge, or a heart wrenching story.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- most overrated game to ever plague the front page of steam\n- Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.\n- I have never cried so damn much at a game\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- if you're looking to experience the greatest time travel drama ever made then I really recommend giving it a chance because there is a lot to love here. Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate. If you've only watched the anime, this is worth checking out for the additional endings and science themes.\n\nSteins;Gate Elite is a new way to discover the classic story, fusing the anime with the visual novel. El Psy Kongroo, 10/10\n- Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.\n- As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^\n- Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
