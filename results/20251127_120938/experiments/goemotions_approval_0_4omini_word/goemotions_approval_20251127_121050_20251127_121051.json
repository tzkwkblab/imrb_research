It takes a lot of courage and persistence.\n- That kinda true honestly lol. Just has more potential\n- Ahhh, I was curious about that since I do both Postmates and IC at the same time.\n- It's not like it's a bad thing...\n- Ah yes that makes sense - the gofundme for her and the workers seems to be taking off at least (if it’s legit)\n- Buddy... Are you ok? Is there a teacher at your school that's strange? Kidding. Nice post as always.\n- Oh 100%. And I could see [NAME] & [NAME] both picking [NAME] cause of how she wanted to play the game.\n- 100%. She's made herself vulnerable to being sued by a few people.\n- I agree. Verbatim.\n- Omg, you are so right! 🤮\n- * yes * yes * yes * yes\n- Don't listen to much prog or hardcore, I love some black metal though.\n- [NAME] is an **integrity** man. Without it, there is nothing. edit 1:without it, not with it, sorry typo\n- Most of the people on top aren't even very relevant anymore, at least not nearly as relevant as they used to be\n- Not sure how kittens “lol” but I’ll take your word for it.\n- Another church stolen from us.

It's not financially feasible.\n- You only saw one piece of luggage. I’m not a fan of overly criticizing the things we don’t see.\n- Maybe I'm overly cautious, but when I was single I stayed away from people who worked with me. \n- [NAME] is not good enough to get that angry.\n- Sir, you have been warned. You antagonistic attitude will not be tolerated. Please try harder at being a model citizen. Thank you for your cooperation.\n- Nothing happens. However, I'm glad that ICOs have ceased to appear. \n- no it is not the same. At the level of 3k in income then it may seem the same or trivial to bother with though.\n- So, [NAME] was also paying to allow her to eat healthier. Let’s look at the bright side! \n- dude people here can be assholes. there’s nothing wrong with taking a break.\n- That’s not proof.\n- No, you won the 23rd.\n- I can't read Korean. Out of curiosity, what are the others?\n- I hate to break it to you but [NAME] ARENT signing here\n- Am yisrael chai is a phrase we should never take for granted.\n- No they haven’t and that’s probably a lot of the problem\n- We don't deserve them but I'm so grateful they're here 🙏\n- I am just attracted to mouthy Jersey girls, what can I say?

Its not real socialism 2.) All government is socialism pick one \"socialists\" fire departments arent socialist \n- That’s not true. She represents those who voted her into power.\n- It's a really bad attempt to get attention and make people mad, that everyone in this thread has decided to indulge.\n- It was always kind of a consideration when I did have opening and closing blinds. None of them problems anymore.\n- Makes sense, but I imagine if they wanted the land that badly theyd just buy it off him\n- That’s my favorite way to introduce myself tbh\n- I cannot remember the dude's name, but I used to LOVE to watch him on Poker After Dark.\n- In the first game, definitely, but they're more even in 2/3. \n- I really hate this jersey and it just doesn't seem like a Sabres logo despite being the most accurate to the name of the team.\n- Don't attend.
