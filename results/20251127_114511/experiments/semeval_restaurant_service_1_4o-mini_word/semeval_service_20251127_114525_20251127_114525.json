prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .\n- Ever since I bought this laptop , so far I 've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad $T$ I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines .\n- $T$ is great , takeout is good too .\n- I have been going to this restaurant for years , in the past the $T$ was average and the food inconsistant .\n- My husband and I have been there at least 6 times and we 've always been given the highest $T$ and often free desserts .\n- they did n't disappoint , $T$ from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .\n- In desparation , I called their $T$ and was told that my warranty had expired -LRB- 2 days old -RRB- and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me -LRB- `` have your credit card ready '' -RRB- .\n- My problem was with $T$ .\n- This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and $T$ was excellent .\n- sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad $T$ .\n- $T$ was prompt and courteous .\n- Interesting selection , good wines , $T$ fine , fun decor .\n- A very inviting restaurant , with friendly $T$ .\n- :-RRB- Great product , great price , great delivery , and great $T$ .\n- We been there and we really enjoy the food , was areally great food , and the $T$ was really good .\n- $T$ was good and food is wonderful .\n- To be fair , the food still is good and the $T$ is quick and attentative even though its usually very busy .\n- This is what I call a good $T$\n- The $T$ was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura .\n- I HAVE NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL -LRB- OR BAD $T$ -RRB- @ PIGALLE .\n- The $T$ was pretty poor all around , the food was well below average relative to the cost , and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place .\n- It 's a shame that a nice , convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy $T$ .\n- Otherwise , this place has great $T$ and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .\n- The $T$ was excellent , the food was excellent , but the entire experience was very cool .\n- Not only is the $T$ great , but forming conversation around a table is so easy beacuse the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable .\n- The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt $T$ .\n- Newegg 's $T$ was great as always , I contacted them late Friday night , and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday .\n- So what am I supposed to do ? The LG service center can not provide me the `` service '' when it is called the `` $T$ '' .\n- The $T$ was dreadfully slow -LRB- the place was only half full -RRB- and a smile would have been nice ...\n- The $T$ , wine selection , ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition .\n- everything is scrumptious , from the excellent $T$ by cute waitresses , to the extremely lush atmosphere .\n- The $T$ is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better .\n- This is my first Dell I heard their $T$ was lacking and that they were working on improving it !\n- You do n't go to Mizu for excellent $T$ , you go for the large amounts of food , the amiable atmosphere , and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place .\n- The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , $T$ was great and the food was excellent !\n- The $T$ was bad , the food took to forever to come , we sat on the upper level .\n- $T$ was good and so was the atmosphere .\n- The ambience was nice , but $T$ was n't so great .\n- The $T$ was typical short-order , dinner type .\n- The $T$ was great as well .\n- THE $T$ IS TERRIFIC !!\n- I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly $T$ to a 15 person party .\n- The happy hour is so cheap , but that does not reflect the $T$ or the atmosphere .\n- After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs -LRB- $T$ was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again -RRB- , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .\n\n【グループB】\n- I was with a party of 7 -LRB- close but not next the the $T$ -RRB- and we were eating with our coats on .\n- The little $T$ that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .\n- it might be something deep within Windows , for I was unable to create a disk image on my $T$ .\n- overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp -LRB- including $T$ -RRB- , a solid deal as well .\n- One should not go to Lucky Strike for the $T$ .\n- I hope to edit this in the next few hours , I am going to try to install my own copy of $T$ .\n- When my husband and go there , we spend $ 60.00 -LRB- have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more -RRB- I ca n't say any more , it a place you 'll never forget If you never go , you 'll miss A $T$ of your life time\n- The $T$ here was great , a treat from beginning to end .\n- I had the same reasons as most PC users : the price , the overbearing restrictions of $T$ and lack of support for games .\n- I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the $T$ .\n- Try the $T$ .\n- If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great $T$ and excellent service , this is the place .\n- Although the tables may be closely situated , the candle-light , $T$ and service overcompensate .\n- BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + -LRB- $T$ , service , respect for old men who are n't familiar with the technology -RRB- DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple\n- INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT $T$ .\n- What can you say about a place where the $T$ brings out the wrong entree , then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back -LRB- which she did politely , by the way -RRB- .\n- A cheap eat for NYC , but not for $T$ .\n- The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri , sevpuri and $T$ , as well as other great indian appetizers .\n- Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for $T$ and cheese .\n- Montparnasse 's $T$ -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .\n- They do n't walk around with the $T$ .\n- Right off the major deegan you get $T$ from all over the city .\n- By far the best $T$ I have had in a fast food restaurant .\n- I really like both the scallops and the $T$ -
