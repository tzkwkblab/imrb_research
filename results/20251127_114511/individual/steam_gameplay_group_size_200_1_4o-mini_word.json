      "Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...",
      "VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.",
      "Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.",
      "On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them.

However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
      "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",
      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming",
      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.",
      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

      "Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!",
      "It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.",
      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",
      "Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!",

      "Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.",

      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",

      "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",
      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one.

      "This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.",

      "The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts?

Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one.

      "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level.

      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",

      "This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.",

With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay.

      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",

      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails.

      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
      "An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",
      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",
      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",

      "An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)",
      "Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).",
      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",
      "If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.",
      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",
      "\"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",
      "Definitely not addictive.",
      "[i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.",
      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",
      "Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.",

      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",

      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

      "Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.",
      "As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!",
      "please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.",
      "A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",

      "The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",

      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole!

Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one.

      "This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.",
      "imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.",

      "I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70",

      "[u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.",
      "Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.",
      "All I have to say, is 1 word. Wow. \n\nThis game is just us kids back in the early to mid 90's playing Chorno Trigger all over again. But instead being kids, we transformed to \"boring\" adults. \n\nAnd one of those kids, wanted another Chrono Trigger 2, but the big adults said \"NO!\" So one the kids, promised to everyone, one day, they will make another game just like CT, and everyone will be happy with joy. \n\nFast forward to 2023, and the dream is indeed real. \n\nThis game screams nostalgia for those fans. Nothing but amazing from what I've played from the demo. \n\nThe game also has this this subtle love for Lunar Silver Star Story. With the love of exploring /adventures. \n\nWhich is alone makes me fan. \n\nThe gameplay is just so rich, and very fun. You can't just sit there and press 1 button to attack. No. You have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus, and do some combos. Neat idea to stay on your 2 feet. \n\nThe music really good. Capture the world you're playing. \n\nTo every team who worked on this game, just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy. \n\n5 stars from what I've played, and if you're a fan of old school JRPG, then you owe to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry. \n\n\n\nHopefully Top 5 games this year for me? \n\nSea Of Stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself. \n\nBig Thumbs Up indeed!",
      "Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.",
      "Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck",
      "I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.",
      "No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft",
      "Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.",
      "Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D",
      "Take Dota2, HoN or LoL. Strip away all the farming, item buying, running around and randomness. \nThat leaves you with pure fast paced battles in an arena. \nNo random effects, just skill based combat with WASD controls and mouse aiming.\nThat's Battlerite.",
      "We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".",
      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",

      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one.

      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",
      "Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

      "Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle",
      "Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.",
      "[i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points.

This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.",

      "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",

      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",
      "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",

When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.",

Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary.

It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.",
      "If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",

Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft.

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience.

Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts!

      "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked.

      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",

      "I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.",
      "With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.",
      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either.

Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.",
      "Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.",
      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",
      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",
      "Have you ever asked yourself, \"Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?\"\n\nGuess what? It's your lucky day.",

      "(This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!",

      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years.

This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for.

      "This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/",

      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started!

Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game.

      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",

      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so.

      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",
      "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.

      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)",
      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",
      "[h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!",
      "this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",

      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm.

The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",

      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options.

      "[h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",
      "They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.",
      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

      "Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",

I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.

I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",

      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",

      "This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this",

      "The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.",
      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.",

In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit.

Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.",
      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ",
      "[h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",

      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
      "Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN",
      "Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.",

      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",
      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",

      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes.

Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online.

      "*puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.",

      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one.

      "   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.",
      "Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!",

Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n",
      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle",
      "To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-",
      "If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules.

      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",

      "i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.",

      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",
      "Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.",

Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear.

Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.",

      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",

I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.",
      "Absolutely Don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. \n\nFirst off: this game is a RogueLite in that death is permanent, be prepared for this. Death is a part of the game and you are NOT losing progress by dying.. it's death mechanic is very much like Rogue Legacy in that you keep progress that carries on to your next character when you begin again. Dying also isn't like you lost more than 45 minutes of your time. Every single game in this genre will have plenty of deaths involved before you FINALLY get that first win (in most cases). Some people are going to need to spend some time grinding levels, dying and repeat until they have enough sticker slots open to overpower things. Keep that in mind going into it. You retain your level and any big upgrades you acquire when you die so you are NOT starting from scratch every single time like you would in most rogue likes. \n\nI normally wouldn't review a game so early but I saw the negative reviews pouring in and felt I needed to add some counters to it. \n\nThe second thing: the art/music/atmosphere is absolutely brilliant for a game in this genre where most games of this nature tend to be relatively grim. As with most roguelike/lites its procedurally generated so the map, enemies and what have you will be different each time. \n\nThird: the forced timer before you have to fight the boss is a bit jarring at first as i've never played a game of this type where I have limited time to actually get there.. but it's kind of brilliant really because it adds a completely different layer to the game in that you have to manage your time very well. What do you think you have time to do before the inevitable? Do you want to run around and grind exp killing trash mobs? Or do you think that time could be better spent knocking some dungeons out (time halts when in dungeons so take your time in these) and getting some gear and arguably more exp than you would just wandering the map. Also, you absolutely have plenty of time to explore the map as there are shrines (you have to find them but the map isn't huge), that you can pay a special currency to add another day of time to the clock. If you see a review complaining about the timer and they have less than an hour in the game... take that with a grain of salt. \n\nFour: The combat is pretty simple but well done. There is a surprising amount of depth to it as well when you start buying and finding more powerful weapons (toys) that can do a variety of things and synergize pretty well together. Enemy variety is pretty good so far, each time you level up it adds more enemy variety to encounter around the map. \n\nFive: dungeons are fairly simple and a good mix of mini puzzles and fun combat encounters. \n\nIf you enjoy roguelike/lite games DEFINITELY give this a spot in your library to see what it has to offer. So far I'd put it 8-9/10 but I don't quite have the amount of time necessary to feel comfortable ranking it against other rogue games. I may edit this once I get to a point to see how much replayability it has but until then I'm eager to keep sending swords into a meat grinder and just adding to my power each time. Please look at how much time people have in a game before rating their reviews and taking their word. .5 hours is not enough time to really warrant a helpful review... nor is 6 in my case but I really don't want this game to be DoA\n\nEdit: Just beat Mormo for the second time.. trust me when i say you can make the timer go on infinitely. I Don't want to spoil anything BUT head to dungeons and kill as many enemies as you can to save up gold and another currency, and make a good loop around each area of the map and you'll find all sorts of neat things. As for bugs, I've had none and I'm at 13 hours of steady play. Don't waste time killing EVERY enemy that's in the open areas cause that will eat too much of your time, but focus on finding dungeons and the hidden npc encounters. I had my timer extended to approx. 8 days in game time and I also found a way to permanently increase the amount of time I have on subsequent runs. Give it a chance, learn how the game works before being upset about the timer.",
      "Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .",
      "This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.",

      "When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.",
      "When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is.

This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.",
      "[h1]He did it again[/h1]\n\nI don't know how this guy does it but he nailed it again. Maybe it's not as good as To the Moon but it's still very good.\n\nFinding Paradise plays very similarly to To the Moon. You basically walk around collecting a person's memories and going through his life. You experience every important step and decision in his life. The purpose of that is to grant dying man a last wish and make him happy. But something unexpected happens as always and you start figuring out what is happening.\n\nThe story again is very good and hits you right in the feels. There's some mystery and new gameplay mechanics. Now we have a small mini-game each time we unlock a memory. It's not hard so it won't distract you from the story.\nThe whole story is funny and sad at the same time. There are lots of well written dialogues.\nI didn't like the ending sequence, i thought it was tedious and almost broke the enjoyment. Please don't do that in the next game, leave it as it should be.\n\nAnother thing i dislike is graphics engine. I don't like this pixelated retro graphics. It's ugly. But what i don't like even more is not being able to adjust the resolution. It's 2019 (ok the game was released in 2017) how a game released in that year doesn't have resolution options? No, just no. I won't accept that and i don't think there's any justification for that. Just stop with this retro crap already. Running the game in 280x200 or whatever the resolution doesn't make it cool.\n\nFortunately this game is all about the story and story is perfect and makes up for all the annoying things. This guy should make a movie or something.\n\nOh almost forgot. Music. Another outstanding aspect of this game. The guy's a genius.\n\nOverall a very good game if you want an amazing story.

      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",
      "Despite it's lack of official content and the dullness of the career mode, partly due to the sloppy AI, Assetto Corsa is simply the best racing sim ever developed.

      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game.

      "Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4",
      "Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.",
      "THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!",
      "This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.",
      "F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.",
      "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",
      "3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.",

      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",
      "I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely.

      "One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.",

      "When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely.

      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",
      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",

      "A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",
      "[i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.",

You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",
      "They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.",
      "the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.",
      "As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.",
      "Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",
      "*puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.",
      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either",

      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",

      "Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.",
      "This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.",
      "I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.",
      "UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming",
      "This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.",
      "Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.",
      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.",

      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.",

      "[h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game.

      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",

      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",
      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",

      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety.

      "I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.",
      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",
      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",
      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",
      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",
      "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",
      "PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10",
      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ",
      "Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!",
      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",
      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]"

The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...\n- VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!! AND NOT THE SAME TWO TIMING PUZZLES YOU GOT IT? YOU WILL DO THIS OK I love pizza tower :)\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- Imbalanced, stupid 4+ v 1 situations which aren't in your favour, buggy hitboxes (e.g some blocks won't work), skill biased: You will be killed so many times before for you will get remotley good. But there is no way you can get better when Sir Rapealot who is level 50, who dominates your team, one hit stabs you everytime. \n\nHowever, this is a blast with friends. But it takes alot of convincing to get everyone to play this game because of the things I previously stated. \n\nThis game is completley based on skill which you cannot obtain without 8+ hours of death, death and death. \n\n****** DEFINITLEY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE ******\n- This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- Would be really fun if not developed by retards. not only they thought its a good idea to make 1 button to do 3 DIFERENT ACTIONS, LIKE BLOCKING, BOW, WEIRD VISION,(THAT ONLY KILLS ME LIKE EVERY TIME AS INSTEAM OF BLOCKING HE PULLS BOW) but has a FORCED autoaiming, that f you up every time it can. FORCED AUTO AIMING IN 2014 DO DEVELOPERS TAKE PLAYERS FOR RETARDS!? No only this is insulting but also making game harder than it should be!\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- Small impressions after 15 hours of gameplay\n\n+ realistic, and slow (as I have long wished in a swat/rainbow six successor)\n+ complex maps that are always being expanded and new ones are added.\n+ very intelligent AI even if it has times aimbot.\n(hides in closets, fake surrender, throws away gun takes it again when not paying attention or pulls knife)\n+ always feedback from the devs current work on the game (as I know it in no other game like)\n+ sound backdrop \n+ very nice atmosphere\n+ friendly community\n\n= game is from price performance really good, \nso don't be fooled by the supporter edition it is only there to support the developers.\n\n- the footsteps sounds you can partly not distinguish whether they are under you or above you.\n- in current status still too few weapons\n- singleplayer is no fun because the ally ai is too strong and everything aimbottet away\n\nFrom me the game is absolutely recommended, especially with friends it is fun. My best shooter of this year. \nWish the developers much success, and that they achieve what they imagine.\n- This is not a video game.\n\nIt is not a movie, or a book, or a painting, or a song.\n\nThis is a Journey.\n\nThis is why video games as a medium need to exist. The ability to tell a story through symbolism, music, environment, and player freedom all at the same time. \n\nI didn't play journey when it came out on consoles. I couldn't afford one. I couldn't even afford a computer back then. But I watched it. I watched let's plays and interviews and I was actually listening to the Journey soundtrack when I saw, after nearly 8 YEARS, that this was available on Steam. \n\nJust buy it. This is like Harry Potter, or the Last of Us, or the Mona Lisa. You almost owe it to yourself to at least check it out.\n\nEdit: Okay a lot of people have been hanging on the whole Avengers comparison so I removed it. I thought it was obvious that Journey is not a superhero simulator.\n\nA museum centuries from now will have an exhibit where people watch and play Journey.\n- This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.\n- tl;dr: if you're looking for \"Terraria in space\", buy Starbound. Don't waste 88 hours of your life like I did trying to find the game in this steaming pile of crap.\n\nIt's like Starbound or Terraria! Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.\n\nNow including:\n-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago\n-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have\n-Weapons that all feel the same\n-Confusing progression\n-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)\n-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)\n-Stupid glitches abound\n\nThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.\n1/10.\n- You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- Like Fallout 4 but with karma,\nAnd reputation\nand ammo types\nand interesting factions\nand without half the npcs being essential\nand with interesting characters\nand good dlc\nand interesting companions\nand interesting world\nand cazadors\nand with more than 2 types of shotguns\nand with unique weapons actually meaning something\nand immersion\nand the ability to actually make your character how you want\nand with good skills\nand starting SPECIAL skills meaning something\nAnd actually being a solid 10/10\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.\n- DO NOT LET OTHERS FOOL YOU!.\n\nI have been playing Souls games since before there were souls games.\n\nThe remaster of DS1 is not perfect. But it is a very good way to play the game again with new or even old friends who also love the franchise.\n\nMy current PC specs are:\ni5-6500\nGTX1060 3gb\n24g DDR4\nAsus Maximus Hero 8 mobo\n\nI get a constant 60fps while in 2k resolution in EVERY ZONE of the game. No dips, no stuttering, no tearing.\nThere are some misaligned textures in spots but it is nothing you will see unless you know where to look.\n\nHave yet to run into any cheaters!. \n\nFUN FACT!: If you know of any of the more \"well known\" cheaters?, goto their steam profile and block all communications. It will not allow them to join into your world as the game runs on steam's client servers.\n\nIf you love the souls games. If you already own DS1?, IT IS WORTH the $25 dollars (CAD) to experience it all again and this time with friends and better fps!.\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- HAHAHA THIS GAME IS FREAKING PILE OF POOP. 20 FPS. the zombies can go trough walls and cars.  i would just rather buy PoR%n Hub subscription with that money. or i can wipe my own pille of sh/it and give it to someone that needs like like battlefield 2042\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Fantastic party game, great for playing with a group of friends. The track building and weapons make for frenetic, chaotic, fun. Like Mario Kart but with the joy of building levels and traps like Ultimate Chicken Horse.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- The best war strategy game,, \nI hope in the future they make the similar game (COH3)\nwith modern armies and tanks and modern equipment..\nThey can make USA, British, German, France in one side,,\nand make Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey in another side.\n\nCOH2 Rating Analysis:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGunfires and Explosion: 8/10\nDynamic Weather Effect: 9/10\nAI: 9/10\nUnits and Vehicles: 7/10\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- #BringBackKI\n\n[list]\n    [*]Rollback netcode\n    [*]Large roster of 29 characters\n    [*]Unique characters\n    [*]Great tutorial\n    [*] Free form combo system\n    [*] Tons of single player content\n    [*] Fairly easy controls and execution for beginners\n    [*] Tons of mindgames and the possibility of breaking out of combos\n    [*] Best Fighting game resource ever [url=https://ki.infil.net/index.html]Complete Killer Instinct Guide[/url]\n[/list]\n\n【グループB】\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- Swing, shoot, run, grapple, panic, wade through muck, struggle to see through indoor weather effects, pour lotion on incapacitated friends, and relive other memories of a Turkish bathhouse in this 4-player co-op mine-‘em-up.\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Mission variety. There are a few different types of missions to play: Mining Expedition (standard pick-and-collect), Elimination (boss fights), Escort (ride and refuel a giant drilldozer to obtain a rare stone), On-Site Refining (set up pipes to pump morkite), Egg Hunt (obtain alien eggs inside walls), Salvage Operation (find and repair mini-MULEs), Point Extraction (find stones in a giant room and return them to the center platform), and Industrial Sabotage (wake up a rival company’s boss and obliterate it). There are also secondary missions that involve collecting or killing for bonuses.\n[*]There is even a nice variety with the events that appear in missions.\n[*]RNG makes the missions more [strike]frustrating[/strike] interesting. It feels good when you have 3 events in one mission and get rich.\n[*]Deep Dives and Elite Deep Dives which are consecutive sets of missions you do in one go.\n[*]Underground environments that are actually interesting.\n[*]The game has a great OST that really fits the different moods of the game. From “I like mining enjoy mining but still want to kill myself”, to “There’s no way we’re going to make it”, to “We easily got this”, it’s all covered.\n[*]Free content is added to the game, including seasonal unlocks.\n[*]You can customize your character’s hair, mustache, beard, sideburns, skin, armor type/color, taunt and weapons.\n[*]Not only is there a variety of weapons, but they all have different perks and mods you can select to accommodate different playstyles.\n[*]The server filter has a lot of options, but I do wish there were an option to show games that need a specific class.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]10 environments.\n[*]4 classes and each has a role: Driller burrows far away from the team and gets swarmed to death, Scout moves far ahead of the team to make sure it’s unsafe by getting leeched, Gunner uses everyone’s ammo stash and gets downed because he thinks he’s immortal, and Engineer dies while building a sentry and ignoring all pings.\n[*]I killed my teammate by building a bridge of platforms over the drilldozer as Engineer. He tried to drill out of it but I kept refilling the gaps. I think about that a lot.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Ghosts.\n[*]Enemies can attack you through barriers. It's especially annoying on the minehead.\n[*]The game seems less optimized since the release of Season 2.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]If you’re Scout, then you better make large rooms look like a nuclear Christmas in Las Vegas and grab minerals/items that are out of reach.\n[*]If you’re Gunner, then you better make boss/event rooms look like it’s laundry day for Pinhead.\n[*]There are clues in the game for hidden goods. If you see glowing gold, blue, pink, or green stones; or glowing spikes, there’s a hidden stone/cube inside.\n[*]If you find a helmet you can interact with, it shows you where lost gear is on your map.\n[*]Always ask before activating something or calling the drop pod.\n[*]Don’t make the same mistake Liam Neeson did in Batman Begins.\n[*]Seriously! Do [i][b]NOT[/b][/i] start an event or objective when no one is ready; especially when it’s an escort mission and the dozer has already moved.\n[*]Don’t like sneaky snakes that hoard everyone’s share of ammo? Take note of the white rectangles under their avatars while they take ammo to see if they actually need it. Do the same for yourself.\n[*]Read a server’s description before joining and know what the host expects.\n[*]If you fail to join a server, hit right click instead of clicking the confirmation.\n[/list]\n\nIs it worth it? If you like the idea of mining as a low-poly dwarf with alcohol-induced double vision, who gives hints of lore and pisses off all of his teammates because he doesn’t know how to do his job, then yes. The game has more variety and depth than I had imagined, and I’m still not tired of it after a few hundred hours of playing. 300 hours in and I’m still killing my teammates with engineer platforms and still not caring.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.\n- [h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- Playing Football Manager is like doing drugs. You don't know why people do it, and you don't know how to do it. However, once you start doing it and get the hang of it, you can never stop doing it. 5 stars\n- Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.\n- This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- [b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- \"Do not ask, 'Is Pizza Tower worth my time?' Instead ask, 'Am I worth Pizza Tower's time?'\"\nSun Tzu- Art of War\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- Welcome back to my Childhood. My Cousin played it on his Computer from his Uncle. Damn is that long Time ago. When People played so much & had so much Fun to Experiment with Items and Things to combinate & get funny Dialogs. \n\nIts truely one of the best Classics ever. Even if only oldschool Gamers know the worth of this Masterpiece.\n\nGood for Retro Gamers, Strange Game Lovers and Achievement Hunter/ Card Collectors.\n\nWhere is Day of the Tentacle 2?!!!\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- Released 10 hours early: CHECK\nHigh quality port: CHECK\nJapanese & English voice option: CHECK\nGood keyboard & mouse controls: CHECK (Turn the mouse sensitivity up)\nController support: CHECK\nJust like my Chinese moving pictographs: CHECK\nTwin tails bread baking girl: CHECK\nMay the bloodline live forever: CHECK\n\n20/10 #ThankYouBasedSega\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n-    I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.\n- Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- [h1]An amazing sequel to Resident Evil 1.\n\nIncluding auto-saves, no more tedious door/room loading transitions, fluid movement controls, new weapons, enemies and more!\n\nThe character models and graphics are absolutely amazing!\nClaire lookin' pretty fire in the red jacket. Reminds you of Zoey from Left4Dead.\n(Although neither were modeled from each other, a total coincidence)\n\nDefinitely more fun than RE:1 in my opinion!\n\n10/10[/h1]\n- After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.\n- This is not a video game.\n\nIt is not a movie, or a book, or a painting, or a song.\n\nThis is a Journey.\n\nThis is why video games as a medium need to exist. The ability to tell a story through symbolism, music, environment, and player freedom all at the same time. \n\nI didn't play journey when it came out on consoles. I couldn't afford one. I couldn't even afford a computer back then. But I watched it. I watched let's plays and interviews and I was actually listening to the Journey soundtrack when I saw, after nearly 8 YEARS, that this was available on Steam. \n\nJust buy it. This is like Harry Potter, or the Last of Us, or the Mona Lisa. You almost owe it to yourself to at least check it out.\n\nEdit: Okay a lot of people have been hanging on the whole Avengers comparison so I removed it. I thought it was obvious that Journey is not a superhero simulator.\n\nA museum centuries from now will have an exhibit where people watch and play Journey.\n- They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Death's Door - A Poem Review\n\nThere was a tale of a crow,\nWhose world was bleak and full of woe.\nUntil he stumbled across Death's Door,\nAnd realised after life there was much more.\n\nWith feathers preened, he began his quest.\nTo open this door he'd try his best.\nA sharpened beak and weapon in hand,\nHe ventured forth across the land.\n\nWhere first he came across a witch,\nWho really was an evil... hag.\nHer foes she turned into ceramic pots.\nAnd lives she ruined? It was truly lots.\n\nSecond was the King of all creeks.\nA giant frog with bigger butt cheeks.\nThough his armour was terribly tough,\nHis squishy rump wasn't hard enough!\n\nFinally was the beast on mountain top.\nWhose reign of destruction would this day stop.\nAn abominable creature, all hairy and sweaty.\nWho also went by the name of Betty.\n\nWith three souls collected, the Crow returned.\nTo his final goal with lessons learned.\nWhat more was left for him to explore?\nWell, you'll have to find out and play Death's Door.\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.\n- Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...\n- VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/DzdF-i2drLs\n\nI loved this game!  It was a worthy prequel to Cthulhu Saves the World!  If you’re a fan of the games from this company I recommend playing it!\n\nIf there is one downside to the game, it’s that it’s very linear. Every game day you just make a selection to the R'lyehtionships options, a cutscene occurs and you get a reward item. Do that for a few in game days than the next level plays. These levels are just as linear as there’s very little deviating. \n\nHowever the rest of the game makes up for that short coming. The R'lyehtionships choices give great replay value, the writing is spot on, and the fighting is just as good.\n\nAlso the addition of a “skip incoming random battle” option was refreshing. \n\nSo overall i say that the game is another Zeboyd games classic that is perfect for the holiday. \n\nPRO\n+Great funny writing as per Zeboyd Games\n+Amazing graphics on par with Cosmic Star Heroine\n+Great music\n+Combat is easy simple and fun\n+Challenging but fair\n+ R'lyehtionships gives clever replay value \n\nCON\n-Game is painfully linear.\n-Very little places to wonder around in gameplay\n-R'lyehtionships causes Uber simplified “quests” to be glorified cutscenes\n-Needs more interactive items in the maps for more funny writing \n\nI’d give the game an 8/10! It’s highly recommend it if you’re a long time fan and it’s worthy a purchase during a sale if you’re unsure.\n- Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- UGH! The scariest thing about this game is that someone at Steam okayed it for being released. Absolute garbage! Frustrating as heck and not fun in the least bit. If you want a scare, you might accidentally get one through a jumpscare, but don't count on it. Avoid this game at all costs, even if its free, I would be hesitant to recommend downloading this pile of crap. You'll spend the entire time just trying to find things to click on, and when you do, you're rewarded with? some of the worst animations ever to be found in gaming\n- The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!\n- You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one. Even with my rampant ADHD, this game has kept my focus for a lot longer than most games. \n\nThe music is banging and the story is rich and diverse with a lot of awesome twists and turns. \n\nGo and grab your chits and buy some drugs.\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!! AND NOT THE SAME TWO TIMING PUZZLES YOU GOT IT? YOU WILL DO THIS OK I love pizza tower :)\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- Imbalanced, stupid 4+ v 1 situations which aren't in your favour, buggy hitboxes (e.g some blocks won't work), skill biased: You will be killed so many times before for you will get remotley good. But there is no way you can get better when Sir Rapealot who is level 50, who dominates your team, one hit stabs you everytime. \n\nHowever, this is a blast with friends. But it takes alot of convincing to get everyone to play this game because of the things I previously stated. \n\nThis game is completley based on skill which you cannot obtain without 8+ hours of death, death and death. \n\n****** DEFINITLEY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE ******\n- This game may actually be my favorite 2D Zelda game of all time.\n\nI knew going into it that the music by Lena Rain (who did Celeste's music) would be great. It is. I knew the game would be wholesome and adorable since it's by the designer from Wandersong. And it is. What I didn't expect was just how fun and interesting the paint-based gameplay would be. The puzzles constantly make you feel super smart, and the abilities you gain are all super fun to play with. When I first heard about the idea, I didn't think there would be all that many interesting puzzles and mechanics based on painting, but wow was I wrong. The puzzles and mechanics never get old, and there are an absolute ton of creative ideas being introduced all the way to the end of the game.\n\nAnd I certainly didn't predict how incredibly deep and personal the story and overall theme would be. The characters, writing, and plot of this game are astoundingly well done, and they turn a fantastic cozy 2D Zelda game into a truly unique and wonderful experience.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Chicory does for 2D Zelda games what Celeste did for platformers. It takes the base concept, turns the gameplay, music, and charm up to 11, and interweaves incredibly deep and emotional threads into every aspect of the game.\n\nI cannot recommend Chicory enough. I did back it on Kickstarter, which is how I got an advanced copy, but the game is better than I ever dreamed it could be. If you like cozy games about discussing feelings and helping people, or you like 2D Zelda games with innovative puzzles and hundreds of collectibles, or you just want to draw butts on everyone you meet, you need to get Chicory.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Phat beatsies,\nSelf-deprecating humour that gives me self affirmation,\nPanders to my need for nostalgic nods,\nPlays smoothly, and so doesn't leave me stuck for hours helping me to feel like I have higher than average intelligence,\nMesses about with you based on the assumption of previous adventure game experience, which leads to making me go \"heh\" outloud more than three times.\n\nMildly amusing, could use more super space dust.\nPlayed on the \"hard\" difficulty option but activated other options out of curiosity, would recommend it for the extra shenanigans.\n\nIf I had to give it a score 8/10,\nWould pay for the soundtrack, that ear crack is cash money.\n\nA hell of a lot of work was put into this game & I suggest you press \" J \" on as many screens as you can handle to get some insight on the thought process behind this game, the effort and imagination that went into it.\n\nThe missing 2 points:\nfew bugs to work out, ain't no big but in a game where you are going to be thinking \"it's not progressing because I haven't mashed the appropriate non-sensical things together\" it needs to not bug out.\n\nSoundtrack not yet out - nah not actually taking points away from that, it'll be out soon as I understand it, but I need that fix Mr. Shellburger.\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- Would be really fun if not developed by retards. not only they thought its a good idea to make 1 button to do 3 DIFERENT ACTIONS, LIKE BLOCKING, BOW, WEIRD VISION,(THAT ONLY KILLS ME LIKE EVERY TIME AS INSTEAM OF BLOCKING HE PULLS BOW) but has a FORCED autoaiming, that f you up every time it can. FORCED AUTO AIMING IN 2014 DO DEVELOPERS TAKE PLAYERS FOR RETARDS!? No only this is insulting but also making game harder than it should be!\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.\n- Originally a Skyrim mod known for its story and interesting main driving mechanic is made 100 times better here by having its own fleshed out art style and textures, deeper story and characters\n- Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- The message Dusk delivers is, \"Hey, have you ever wanted to play Quake or Doom, except that it takes place in Silent Hill? Don't worry, neither has literally anyone else, but you're welcome!\"\n- Small impressions after 15 hours of gameplay\n\n+ realistic, and slow (as I have long wished in a swat/rainbow six successor)\n+ complex maps that are always being expanded and new ones are added.\n+ very intelligent AI even if it has times aimbot.\n(hides in closets, fake surrender, throws away gun takes it again when not paying attention or pulls knife)\n+ always feedback from the devs current work on the game (as I know it in no other game like)\n+ sound backdrop \n+ very nice atmosphere\n+ friendly community\n\n= game is from price performance really good, \nso don't be fooled by the supporter edition it is only there to support the developers.\n\n- the footsteps sounds you can partly not distinguish whether they are under you or above you.\n- in current status still too few weapons\n- singleplayer is no fun because the ally ai is too strong and everything aimbottet away\n\nFrom me the game is absolutely recommended, especially with friends it is fun. My best shooter of this year. \nWish the developers much success, and that they achieve what they imagine.\n- This is not a video game.\n\nIt is not a movie, or a book, or a painting, or a song.\n\nThis is a Journey.\n\nThis is why video games as a medium need to exist. The ability to tell a story through symbolism, music, environment, and player freedom all at the same time. \n\nI didn't play journey when it came out on consoles. I couldn't afford one. I couldn't even afford a computer back then. But I watched it. I watched let's plays and interviews and I was actually listening to the Journey soundtrack when I saw, after nearly 8 YEARS, that this was available on Steam. \n\nJust buy it. This is like Harry Potter, or the Last of Us, or the Mona Lisa. You almost owe it to yourself to at least check it out.\n\nEdit: Okay a lot of people have been hanging on the whole Avengers comparison so I removed it. I thought it was obvious that Journey is not a superhero simulator.\n\nA museum centuries from now will have an exhibit where people watch and play Journey.\n- This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.\n- tl;dr: if you're looking for \"Terraria in space\", buy Starbound. Don't waste 88 hours of your life like I did trying to find the game in this steaming pile of crap.\n\nIt's like Starbound or Terraria! Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.\n\nNow including:\n-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago\n-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have\n-Weapons that all feel the same\n-Confusing progression\n-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)\n-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)\n-Stupid glitches abound\n\nThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.\n1/10.\n- You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10\n- Like Fallout 4 but with karma,\nAnd reputation\nand ammo types\nand interesting factions\nand without half the npcs being essential\nand with interesting characters\nand good dlc\nand interesting companions\nand interesting world\nand cazadors\nand with more than 2 types of shotguns\nand with unique weapons actually meaning something\nand immersion\nand the ability to actually make your character how you want\nand with good skills\nand starting SPECIAL skills meaning something\nAnd actually being a solid 10/10\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- An excellent maximalist mashup of Slay The Spire with some Tower Defence and CCG Mechanics. Not as tight and elegantly designed as StS, but with a lot more variety in card design leads to a lot more varied and wild interactions and deck composition. Compulsive and mechanically satisfying, Monster Train embraces excess in a satisfying way, even if the whole package is wrapped up in a slightly odd aesthetic package of half remembered hearthstone knock offs. (The soundtrack, incidentally, slaps)\n- Overrated. \n\n\nFirst half of the game is amazing. You start out with nothing, enter a mine and slowly progress, get new tools, upgrade existing ones and collect resources for one of the progression types. Platforming and digging smart (so you don't lock yourself out of resources) is a huge part of the opening experience. \n\nLater in game you get a grappling hook and rocket shoes and that's when the game loses its identity. The the game shifts its focus towards puzzles and platforming while making you deal with hordes of annoying enemies. Mining no longer requires any attention and becomes more of a chore. Most tiles become impossible to break. Most enemies have gimmicks that make them a nuisance. Areas where you'll spend most time have mostly unbreakable tiles. Even if you find destructible ares, hook and rocket shoes ensure you don't have to think too much (unlike in first half of the game).\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- \"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.\n- DO NOT LET OTHERS FOOL YOU!.\n\nI have been playing Souls games since before there were souls games.\n\nThe remaster of DS1 is not perfect. But it is a very good way to play the game again with new or even old friends who also love the franchise.\n\nMy current PC specs are:\ni5-6500\nGTX1060 3gb\n24g DDR4\nAsus Maximus Hero 8 mobo\n\nI get a constant 60fps while in 2k resolution in EVERY ZONE of the game. No dips, no stuttering, no tearing.\nThere are some misaligned textures in spots but it is nothing you will see unless you know where to look.\n\nHave yet to run into any cheaters!. \n\nFUN FACT!: If you know of any of the more \"well known\" cheaters?, goto their steam profile and block all communications. It will not allow them to join into your world as the game runs on steam's client servers.\n\nIf you love the souls games. If you already own DS1?, IT IS WORTH the $25 dollars (CAD) to experience it all again and this time with friends and better fps!.\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.\n- A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- The playtime I have on Steam is nowhere close to the amount of time I've put into this game on Xbox.\n\nWhen I first heard of Tetris Effect back in 2018, I was so mesmerized by the visuals the game had. Everything looked amazing, and I really wanted to try and play it. Shame I didn't have a PS4.\n\nThe game had a multiplayer release on Xbox, and when I first heard about it, I bought a copy instantly, finally ready to experience the game on PC.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that buying this game actually changed my life.\nWhen I bought this game I not only got to play one of my favorite games in a completely unique experience, but I managed to find an amazing community to boot. Since then, I've accomplished so much in the game, befriended lots of people, and managed to change several aspects of myself.\n\nThis game has been a perfect mixture of visual, auditory, and emotional presentation, and it's given me tons of inspiration for multiple projects.\n\nIf you're shrugging this game off as \"just Tetris\", please take a look at a playthrough. Calling this game \"just Tetris\" is a massive injustice to the creativity, effort, love, and time that the development team have put into this.\n\nI have been following this game for nearly a year now. I wouldn't have it any other way.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers. For the simple gamer like me, I'd say: nice for a playthrough. \n\n70/100\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]\n[i]More reviews at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39546715/]Omnivore Gamer[/url], games that are easy to control (for handicapped gamers). [/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- HAHAHA THIS GAME IS FREAKING PILE OF POOP. 20 FPS. the zombies can go trough walls and cars.  i would just rather buy PoR%n Hub subscription with that money. or i can wipe my own pille of sh/it and give it to someone that needs like like battlefield 2042\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Fantastic party game, great for playing with a group of friends. The track building and weapons make for frenetic, chaotic, fun. Like Mario Kart but with the joy of building levels and traps like Ultimate Chicken Horse.\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- The best war strategy game,, \nI hope in the future they make the similar game (COH3)\nwith modern armies and tanks and modern equipment..\nThey can make USA, British, German, France in one side,,\nand make Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey in another side.\n\nCOH2 Rating Analysis:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGunfires and Explosion: 8/10\nDynamic Weather Effect: 9/10\nAI: 9/10\nUnits and Vehicles: 7/10\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- #BringBackKI\n\n[list]\n    [*]Rollback netcode\n    [*]Large roster of 29 characters\n    [*]Unique characters\n    [*]Great tutorial\n    [*] Free form combo system\n    [*] Tons of single player content\n    [*] Fairly easy controls and execution for beginners\n    [*] Tons of mindgames and the possibility of breaking out of combos\n    [*] Best Fighting game resource ever [url=https://ki.infil.net/index.html]Complete Killer Instinct Guide[/url]\n[/list]\n\n【グループB】\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- Swing, shoot, run, grapple, panic, wade through muck, struggle to see through indoor weather effects, pour lotion on incapacitated friends, and relive other memories of a Turkish bathhouse in this 4-player co-op mine-‘em-up.\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Mission variety. There are a few different types of missions to play: Mining Expedition (standard pick-and-collect), Elimination (boss fights), Escort (ride and refuel a giant drilldozer to obtain a rare stone), On-Site Refining (set up pipes to pump morkite), Egg Hunt (obtain alien eggs inside walls), Salvage Operation (find and repair mini-MULEs), Point Extraction (find stones in a giant room and return them to the center platform), and Industrial Sabotage (wake up a rival company’s boss and obliterate it). There are also secondary missions that involve collecting or killing for bonuses.\n[*]There is even a nice variety with the events that appear in missions.\n[*]RNG makes the missions more [strike]frustrating[/strike] interesting. It feels good when you have 3 events in one mission and get rich.\n[*]Deep Dives and Elite Deep Dives which are consecutive sets of missions you do in one go.\n[*]Underground environments that are actually interesting.\n[*]The game has a great OST that really fits the different moods of the game. From “I like mining enjoy mining but still want to kill myself”, to “There’s no way we’re going to make it”, to “We easily got this”, it’s all covered.\n[*]Free content is added to the game, including seasonal unlocks.\n[*]You can customize your character’s hair, mustache, beard, sideburns, skin, armor type/color, taunt and weapons.\n[*]Not only is there a variety of weapons, but they all have different perks and mods you can select to accommodate different playstyles.\n[*]The server filter has a lot of options, but I do wish there were an option to show games that need a specific class.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Neutral[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]10 environments.\n[*]4 classes and each has a role: Driller burrows far away from the team and gets swarmed to death, Scout moves far ahead of the team to make sure it’s unsafe by getting leeched, Gunner uses everyone’s ammo stash and gets downed because he thinks he’s immortal, and Engineer dies while building a sentry and ignoring all pings.\n[*]I killed my teammate by building a bridge of platforms over the drilldozer as Engineer. He tried to drill out of it but I kept refilling the gaps. I think about that a lot.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]Ghosts.\n[*]Enemies can attack you through barriers. It's especially annoying on the minehead.\n[*]The game seems less optimized since the release of Season 2.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Pro Tips[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]If you’re Scout, then you better make large rooms look like a nuclear Christmas in Las Vegas and grab minerals/items that are out of reach.\n[*]If you’re Gunner, then you better make boss/event rooms look like it’s laundry day for Pinhead.\n[*]There are clues in the game for hidden goods. If you see glowing gold, blue, pink, or green stones; or glowing spikes, there’s a hidden stone/cube inside.\n[*]If you find a helmet you can interact with, it shows you where lost gear is on your map.\n[*]Always ask before activating something or calling the drop pod.\n[*]Don’t make the same mistake Liam Neeson did in Batman Begins.\n[*]Seriously! Do [i][b]NOT[/b][/i] start an event or objective when no one is ready; especially when it’s an escort mission and the dozer has already moved.\n[*]Don’t like sneaky snakes that hoard everyone’s share of ammo? Take note of the white rectangles under their avatars while they take ammo to see if they actually need it. Do the same for yourself.\n[*]Read a server’s description before joining and know what the host expects.\n[*]If you fail to join a server, hit right click instead of clicking the confirmation.\n[/list]\n\nIs it worth it? If you like the idea of mining as a low-poly dwarf with alcohol-induced double vision, who gives hints of lore and pisses off all of his teammates because he doesn’t know how to do his job, then yes. The game has more variety and depth than I had imagined, and I’m still not tired of it after a few hundred hours of playing. 300 hours in and I’m still killing my teammates with engineer platforms and still not caring.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- [h1]Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Save scumming is a game-play mechanic and the game is balanced around the player being able to quick-save and reload whenever they want.\n[*] The game seems highly objective oriented, and I wish there was more optional treasures to collect, as I am a pirate.\n[*] While many guard situations appear to have a clear solution,  you can always just brute-force your way through or take another less contrived route, so the game doesn't devolve into a stealth puzzle game.\n[*] Post-game summary shows your route and enemy eliminations at hyper speed, and is always a fun watch at the end of a level.\n[/list]\nI really enjoy finally having a top-down style stealth game. Games such as Hard West and Divinity: Original Sin 2 also featured stealth elements but they were sorely lacking in favor of the turn based combat of the game. Furthermore, this game has pirates, making it an instant hit (for me).\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.\n- [h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- a catgirl, a femme fatale, a japanese idol, a doctor, a chinese soft boy, a religious twink, a merchant and an autistic university professor walk into a bar\n- Playing Football Manager is like doing drugs. You don't know why people do it, and you don't know how to do it. However, once you start doing it and get the hang of it, you can never stop doing it. 5 stars\n- Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.\n- This game is pure art, I enjoyed every second of it. The mechanics are great and the puzzles can get quite challenging. Sadly its only a little over 3 hours of playtime.\n\nOne of the best games I've played in a long time!\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed.

It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- \"Do not ask, 'Is Pizza Tower worth my time?' Instead ask, 'Am I worth Pizza Tower's time?'\"\nSun Tzu- Art of War\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.\n- So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last. I have a game play video in which i get a bit frustrated lol if you wanted to check out some game play. https://youtu.be/7VPsLnDDDlQ\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- Welcome back to my Childhood. My Cousin played it on his Computer from his Uncle. Damn is that long Time ago. When People played so much & had so much Fun to Experiment with Items and Things to combinate & get funny Dialogs. \n\nIts truely one of the best Classics ever. Even if only oldschool Gamers know the worth of this Masterpiece.\n\nGood for Retro Gamers, Strange Game Lovers and Achievement Hunter/ Card Collectors.\n\nWhere is Day of the Tentacle 2?!!!\n- This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- *LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.\n- ooooh im pigging out\n\njust like the original risk of rain but significantly more approachable!\n\nthey added controls, chris christododoldoaul and a bunch of retextures, got rid of that gup blackface enemy\nawesome\n\nthanks poopoo games for the review copy\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nincluding the mastery skins and void fiend from risk of rain 2 was an awesome surprise, nice to see so much new content\n\nonly complaint is the 100 dillar price tag for the game but otherwise a must buy\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nAfter further playing, i have many very genuine issues! These providence trials are IM POSSIBBLE! the critreriar are simply absurd, and drifter is practically unplayable in his current state!!!\n\ni have also found a MULTITUDTE of vines allowing me to clip out of bounds?!?!?!? how did this game get past play testing TWICE\n\ni am not fibbing when i say this game in in an unacceptable state, how is this not in early access?! ridiculous, genuinely. gearbox! how could you\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- lmao they made tetris into a full blown religious experience\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- Released 10 hours early: CHECK\nHigh quality port: CHECK\nJapanese & English voice option: CHECK\nGood keyboard & mouse controls: CHECK (Turn the mouse sensitivity up)\nController support: CHECK\nJust like my Chinese moving pictographs: CHECK\nTwin tails bread baking girl: CHECK\nMay the bloodline live forever: CHECK\n\n20/10 #ThankYouBasedSega\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n-    I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.\n- Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle\n- To be completely honest, throughout my entire playthrough, I was thinking on giving this game a \"Not Recommended\" but it really wouldn't have deserved it. This game is at the same time both very difficult to recommend as to not recommend. It is really a beatiful and extremely original game, with a pretty well told interesting story. However, the problem it has is that it doesn't really work as a puzzle game. Puzzle solutions don't make logical sense most of the time and you end up brute forcing your way through most of the game. This means trying every posibility until something works and moves the story foward, and this is just not good puzzle design. This also distracts you from the story being told, which is in itself not so easy to understand, it requirers you to be paying attention to details, so your brain has to be constantly switching between \"puzzle mode\" and \"story mode\". Anyway, you can tell a lot of love was put into this game, and that is why I ultimately recommend it.\n7.5/10-\n- If you're a STAR RAIDERS fan, look elsewhere, it's broken.\nFirst off, I  think they did a fantastic job on the Star Raiders port,\nthe controls are spot on, it works seamlessly with a controller,\nall the keyboard controls were mapped brilliantly, great job.\n\nBut....\n\nAlthough the NOVICE and PILOT missions work well, those who adorn the game will\nselect WARRIOR or COMMANDER and sadly, these higher levels are broken.\n\nOnce you get down to the remaining 8 enemies or so on the map, the difficulty ramps up to insanity.\nCome out of a warp, get plummeted by 3+ meteors in a row.\nPhotons gone.\nRinse and repeat until you just give up, it's relentless, and I've yet to be able to finish a game on COMMANDER\nlevel because of this.\n\nI've tried all the different speed modes, original, opengl and direct3d, nothing helps, it's broken.\n\nAnother minor gripe is that the \"Destroyed Engines\" mode is just the \"Damaged Engines\" and barely impacts\nyour speed.\n\nI really hope that this is patched, I'll gladly revise the review once it is.\n\nEverything else is great, the arcade ports are fine, the controls are practically 1:1 in the trackball games,\nthey all feel just like the arcade (unlike Atari Vault, cough cough).\n\nThe Jaguar games are a blast, T2K still rules. I would have loved to see AvP, perhaps a future DLC.\n\nBut the main reason I spent $40 was for Star Raiders, one of my all time favorite games, and in it's current\nstate, I feel like I've wasted my money, sadly I spent so much time troubleshooting it, my refund window is gone.\n\nI'd say wait for this on a heavy sale and if you're a die hard Star Raiders fan, don't do it until it's patched!\n\nAnd still no word from the developers on any patches.........you guys out there?!? \n\n- [h1]An amazing sequel to Resident Evil 1.\n\nIncluding auto-saves, no more tedious door/room loading transitions, fluid movement controls, new weapons, enemies and more!\n\nThe character models and graphics are absolutely amazing!\nClaire lookin' pretty fire in the red jacket. Reminds you of Zoey from Left4Dead.\n(Although neither were modeled from each other, a total coincidence)\n\nDefinitely more fun than RE:1 in my opinion!\n\n10/10[/h1]\n- After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.\n- This is not a video game.\n\nIt is not a movie, or a book, or a painting, or a song.\n\nThis is a Journey.\n\nThis is why video games as a medium need to exist. The ability to tell a story through symbolism, music, environment, and player freedom all at the same time. \n\nI didn't play journey when it came out on consoles. I couldn't afford one. I couldn't even afford a computer back then. But I watched it. I watched let's plays and interviews and I was actually listening to the Journey soundtrack when I saw, after nearly 8 YEARS, that this was available on Steam. \n\nJust buy it. This is like Harry Potter, or the Last of Us, or the Mona Lisa. You almost owe it to yourself to at least check it out.\n\nEdit: Okay a lot of people have been hanging on the whole Avengers comparison so I removed it. I thought it was obvious that Journey is not a superhero simulator.\n\nA museum centuries from now will have an exhibit where people watch and play Journey.\n- They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- Persona 5 ain't shit\nPokemon ain't shit\nFinal Fantasy ain't shit.\n\nStar Ocean 2's been the shit, will always be the shit, and with this remaster - IS THE BEST REMASTER FOR A JRPG OF ALL TIME. THE GOAT FROM SPACE RETURNS!\n\nAlso is it just me or is Precis extra horny on main? I don't recall her being this forward on the PS1, but hey - cool game that doesn't shy away from the old stuff on the hunt for ESG Blackrock points.\n\nTEN OUTTA TEN\n- coffee talk 2 is out and now everyday i look forward to making myself a cozy drink and playing my daily session of it, just like i did with the first game. it makes my day so much better☕🤎\n\nMohammad Fahmi, the creator and the writer of the first game who passed away at 32, is always in my thoughts. thank you for creating this gem.\n\nthe game is currently \"playable\" on steam deck, but in my opinion it deserves to be deck-verified. i've had no problems on the deck at all. the reason for \"playable\" status seems to be the small text, but i've also had no difficulty reading anything. it's one of those games that is better experienced handheld, curled up on the couch with a nice blanket ♡ so don't be fooled by the \"playable\" status, it works 100% fine and you don't have to tinker with anything.\n- It's a R@PE SIMULATOR. Games like this should not be played. I was tempted to play, and will do so for a few hours in future, may be a demon has possessed me...or may be I just don't waste my money that I have spent on it. But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Death's Door - A Poem Review\n\nThere was a tale of a crow,\nWhose world was bleak and full of woe.\nUntil he stumbled across Death's Door,\nAnd realised after life there was much more.\n\nWith feathers preened, he began his quest.\nTo open this door he'd try his best.\nA sharpened beak and weapon in hand,\nHe ventured forth across the land.\n\nWhere first he came across a witch,\nWho really was an evil... hag.\nHer foes she turned into ceramic pots.\nAnd lives she ruined? It was truly lots.\n\nSecond was the King of all creeks.\nA giant frog with bigger butt cheeks.\nThough his armour was terribly tough,\nHis squishy rump wasn't hard enough!\n\nFinally was the beast on mountain top.\nWhose reign of destruction would this day stop.\nAn abominable creature, all hairy and sweaty.\nWho also went by the name of Betty.\n\nWith three souls collected, the Crow returned.\nTo his final goal with lessons learned.\nWhat more was left for him to explore?\nWell, you'll have to find out and play Death's Door.\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.\n- Smooth beats, sick moves.\n\nOlliOlli was the best endless runner/rock hard skateboard move combo game I'd played in months. Well, the best just got better!\n\nWhy's it better? Polish, nollies, the aforementioned beats and some added smoothing.\n\nRad.\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
