      "It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun. The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.",
      "So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.",
      "The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag",
      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",
      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",

      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",

      "To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.",
      "1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews.

      "I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess",

      "I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.",
      "This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!",
      "i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.",
      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",

      "This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",

But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year.

      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch.

      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",
      "I genuinely had no expectations with Odyssey. Assassins Creed died along with Desmond for me. However, I was truly blown away with positivity for this installment of the series. Odyssey reminds me and takes a page from the Witcher 3. It's incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion more superior and engaging than Origins. That said, I couldn't get into Origins it wasn't for me.\n\nI've been a Assassins Creed fan ever since the first game. Over the years the game has evolved, adapted, and improved on every aspect up to Black Flag. I didn't feel the need to play the future installments after Black Flag. In my opinion they didn't fit in the mold of the series and I didn't support the actions Ubisoft were taking with the title. Odyssey changed my perspective on that with its fresh ideas and made me believe that a different direction isn't a bad one.\n\nI still miss my boy Ezio :(",
      "tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.",

      "Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.",
      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.",

You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",

      "Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n",
      "First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!",

      "If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.",
      "The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)",
      "This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.",
      "This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/",
      "Just another pay to win city builder. If you like this kind of thing that's fine but I get rather bored waiting for the extremely slow build times. I'm not going to throw thousands of dollars on a game like this.",
      "This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n",
      "So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game",
      "[h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]",
      "Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.",
      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",
      "They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.",
      "Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.",
      "I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.",
      "This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.",
      "TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.",

      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",
      "This is Wario Land but fast. All the fortnite zoomers are gonna play this and talk about it like Fight Night Fungus ft. Frederick Leopold Fazbearington while nobody's gonna play the Wario Land games :(((( \n\nTLDR: Fire. Goku fortnite. My nuts hang :(",
      "I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.",

      "RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n",
      "Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea.

      "[h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part.

For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10",
      "Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.",
      "This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.\n\nGame of the year for everyone else? Maybe!\n\nLet me tell you some things about this game:\n+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)\n+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump\n+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design\n+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them\n+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you\n+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely\n+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area \"The City of Tears\" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive\n\nMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.\n\nFot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.",
      "An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",
      "POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?",
      "This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN",

A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either.

      "[h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",

      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass.

I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run.

I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.",
      "you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",

      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",

Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla.

      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "Looks like a game for children, but underneath the friendliness there is a great challenge! Move on the rhythm of good songs on a note bar! \n\n[h2]Swim! Swim little tredpole! [/h2]\nYou are a newborn tredpole. The first thing you do is break free of your egg! Through various rivers and waters you journey, and eventually save your pond from a disaster that will occur. \nEverything in the river translates to an instrument tone and respects the height on the note bar. The primary goal is to reach the finish. The melody is depicted as little mines which hurt your health if you swim across one. Along the way you can collect points by collecting bubbles (with a bonus if you collect them all), little bubbles, health packs, and you can slap your tail on bamboo or cymbals that launch you in the air! Many predators would like to make a snack out of you! \nAll this on the rhythm of unique songs! \n\n[h2]Thoughts [/h2]\nThis looks like a friendly game, a bit for kids perhaps, right? Well, I started with letting a non-gamer play this, without success. You need to have musical rhythm in you to perform well. None of my friends possess that really, so a simple playthrough wasn't all that easy. \nThe music is very original, and makes this game fun. It's a tough game, and poses quite a challenge for lovers of rhythm games. I am totally unfamiliar with that breed of gamers.

      "Everyone complained about the bugs and glitches but the real problems are that the game's systems are terribly outdated. People were promised a next-gen experience. I've played games from a decade ago that have better open worlds then this. \n\n- Police appear out of nowhere.\n- Police are amazingly easy to escape. You can walk a block away and lose them.\n- Civilian NPC's appear and disappear when you're not looking.\n- The A.I. is alot my artificial then intelligent. The only reaction they ever have is to duck or completely disappear in thin air. \n- The A.I. is basically on rails; they will not drive or walk around anything you put in front of them, they'll just stop and sit there for eternity.\n- The world doesn't actually feel alive (no random encounters). NPC enemies spawn in the exact same place every single time without fail.\n- Bars and food are exactly the same vendor with a different coat of paint. No matter where you go you can't sit down and eat something, or sit and enjoy a virtual drink (unless it's a talking-scene tied to a quest).\n- You can't interact with shop keepers beyond buying something or receiving maybe two lines of chit-chat. You can't rob them. You can't kill them. You can't get quests from them. They won't even react if you lob a grenade at them.\n- The \"car chases\" are on rails and there's only 3-4 prescripted car chases in the game.\n- Only 2% of \"choices\" your character makes in dialogue has any effect on the story. The rest are just alternate dialogue to give the appearance of choice and replayability. \n- Character starting paths (Street kid, Nomad, Corpo) have little to no affect beyond the first 20 minutes of the game and simple dialogue changes.\n- Player characters have no reflection unless you use the specific mirror located in your apartment. \n- You can't alter the look of your character after the initial character creation. Not even a haircut.\n- Can't customize your apartment in any way, shape, or form.\n- There's almost no reason to ever go back to your apartment after being there the first time.\n- Vehicles can't be customized; no new paints, liveries, or body-pieces.\n- There are 4 mini-games total: Hacking, shooting-range, boxing, and car racing. There are only two shooting-range quests, only 6 boxing matches, and only 4 races. That's it as far as mini-games go.\n\nYou can fix bugs but unless CD somehow improves the lack-luster world and experience they created, I can't recommend this game to anyone.",
      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!",
      "Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.",
      "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",
      "This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.",

That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.",
      "It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. \n\nHomeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. \n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. \n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.",
      "With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.",
      "Absolutely dated graphics that make visibility in this game a total exercise for your eyes, enemies and teammates blend into the background and scenery constantly, friendly markers everywhere obstructing your vision, insanely fast TTK with frustrating bleed mechanics...\n\nAnd the list goes on, it's beyond me how this game is being called a better one than Battlefield, are we even playing the same game at all? This game made me go back playing Battlefield 3. If you want to play a better game than 2042, play any of the others. BF3, BF4, BF1 or even 5, but please, stop shilling games like this and trying to justify it with the price and how many worked on it, this game is not even close to being better than a battlefield game at all",

      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.",
      "This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny",
      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",
      "Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",

      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",
      "Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "While it seems grindy at times, you will probably feel greatly rewarded when you can get enough resolve to spec out a specific build exactly how you want it. I think the progression of the tower abilities and gold gain is great, but even the burdens available don’t seem to switch it up quite enough. I’m on ng+4 and i feel like it’s getting a tad stale. I still like playing it of course. Some classes like the chef make the idea of playing anything else not quite worth it. I’m sure there’s some great niche builds but keep that in mind. Overall, this game keeps you on your toes. If you get hit, it’s almost always because you did something wrong. I LOVE the movement abilities in this game. You can feel like a speed runner with a few hours of practice gliding and jumping. This is a completely different game compared to rogue legacy 1 in all the best ways. 9/10",
      "I'll make this quick.\n\nThis game has been amazing fun so far.\n\nLiving in a clan is definitely a unique thing for farming sims, and it even helps with the gameplay.

The better you do, the better everyone does and visa versa. \n\nI love exploring to find new seeds, herbs, animals and materials... I actually find myself staying up until nearly 2am in game almost every day because of that. \n\nThe npcs seem to be an interesting bunch too, but I have to say that I've yet to see many events with them.

      "I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.",

      "[b]Content Warning[/b]: Discussions of mental illness, attempted suicide, cyberbullying, toxic gamer culture, manipulation/gaslighting\n\nThe protagonist is chosen to be an esports team manager and must make difficult decisions while trying to keep everyone on the team happy. In a society that tells people that winning and success are what give us worth, it can certainly be a struggle to accept a loss. However, if someone is surrounded by healthy friendships and perhaps even a lover, their perspective can be changed, and then it turns out, losing isn’t so bad, actually. \n\n[u]Information[/u]\n    • This is a sequel to Arcade Spirits, but someone can understand this story without knowing the first one. They just wouldn’t get some of the references, as some characters from the first game do make an appearance. \n    • The mini-game is super easy. If you fail, just reload (on the first playthrough). After the first playthrough, a new feature is unlocked to simply scroll back to try a different choice.\n    • The Rival can be friendly or hostile. \n    • Romantic scenes are tame. Implied sex only. The Rival’s romance route is definitely the most risque in terms of dialogue. \n    • 7 romanceable characters: 3 women, 2 men, 1 enby, and the Rival (any gender). \n\n[u]Praises[/u]\n    • Elaboration on the AI Iris’s origins that players probably wondered about in the first game.\n    • Neat character creation setup. Protagonist & Rival.\n    • Several pronoun options. \n    • Indicates whether a choice influences romance or not.\n    • Personality traits like in the first game are back: quirky, steady, kind, gutsy, and flexible.\n    • Amusing effects that company ridiculous jokes.\n    • Disabled character representation. A [i]romanceable[/i] character who’s a gorgeous goth.\n    • Characters are pleasantly racially diverse. \n    • Polyamory route.\n    • Critiques of societal pressures and what exactly “success” means.\n    • Various discussions of having toxic parents and other relatives.\n    • Throughout the story, various social issues are brought up related to the gaming scene: from capitalist ventures like loot boxes to branding.\n    • The game touches heavily on depression and suicide. As someone who has struggled with depression her whole life and, once upon a time, had suicidal tendencies, I found the ways those topics were integrated into the story to be helpful. (There many instances in media about “Shadow Selves” but it reminded me of Persona 4, when characters have to face the parts of themselves they want to deny.)\n    • There is a cat and there is an option to pet it.\n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • Thicc body types for the protagonist/rival are drawn awkwardly and sloppily. I also feel that the devs took a step back on thicc representation in this game vs the first one. While Zapper (a romanceable character) is slightly plump, I wouldn’t necessarily categorize her as “thicc.” There were two genuinely thicc romanceable characters in the first game.\n    • Only one afro-textured hairstyle in character creation, while straight hair has several.\n    • Beginning of the game is a bit rushed. I think it’s because it’s expected of the player to have played the first game and know all about the AI Iris. \n    • I figure the devs wanted to demonstrate what disabled people go through in terms of discrimination and disrespect from others, but I feel they could’ve done better. They gave the protagonist [i]forced[/i] problematic lines and players aren’t gonna feel great about being an a$$hole to a disabled character. \n    • Sometimes, there’s too much telling and not enough showing.\n    • More resource links should be added to help people with depression and suicidal thoughts than the hotline listed after [spoiler]Coda tries to kill himself[/spoiler]. I think it would also be better if those resources were listed in the credits as well. \n\nIt seems like the most common thing people complain about in the other reviews is political preaching being in the game. I agree: things should be shown rather than told, in this case. On the other hand, I’ve literally known gamers who talk about the issues brought up in the game. I didn’t find it [i]that[/i] unrealistic. I think it’s just that a lot of it is condensed into one story, whereas, in real life, these types of subjects come up every now and then over the course of knowing people for years. \n\nDespite the flaws mentioned, I really liked the game. I do believe I liked the first one a bit better, but I’m happy with the sequel overall.

      "The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",
      "Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.",
      "Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.",
      "One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.",

      "Since no one with a positive review is willing to explain why, I guess I will.\n\n          Right off the bat, visually, this game is jaw-droppingly phenomenal. The lighting, presentation, and atmosphere has been brilliantly re-captured to ensure older fans from the first game feel like they are returning to somewhere that feels oddly familiar, yet holds many new and unique encounters we have yet to discover. The colors, especially the greens, pop in just the right way to further emphasize the seemingly calm and collected forest during the day that can quickly change into a dark and unsettling nightmare by night.\n\n\tEndnight has again hit the nail on the head with the combat. Considering the old system of charging up momentum to land attacks worked exceptionally well, it's understandable they did not try and reinvent the wheel. Combat has been expanded and smoothed out just enough to keep it feeling fun, fresh and different. Landing hits is just as satisfying as it was in the old game, and mastering these techniques is especially entertaining with both new enemies and their original, upgraded counterparts. \n\n\tAs far as interaction mechanics, the inventory system has been cleverly improved, and Kelvin is a genuinely cool addition to the game. For other friendless losers such as myself, having Kelvin around is good company. Interacting with him is intuitive and straightforward, and losing track of him isn't a problem with the GPS you get right off the bat. Starting off with some way to orient yourself in a map that's five times bigger than the first game is also a welcome change. The \"quick inventory\" while you're on the move is a welcome upgrade as well. The crafting menu has also been improved, separating custom buildings from presets, which makes it easier to keep track of what you can make using custom buildings. Unfortunately, the garbage control scheme returns so for the first five minutes into my new save I was making the game playable instead of... playing the game.\n\n\tBut holy smokes the building is 1000% better than the first game. You still have your already mentioned presets for use in a pinch, and you have the massively improved custom building. Instead of laying out where you want everything to go all at once, you get to pick and choose as you create your desired structure, which makes it way easier to manage your resources while making it, and also allows you to make changes as you see fit. This is a huge step up from the previous game, and it's great.\n\n\tI see some complaints with the performance but I personally had no issues. With the medium preset my game ran at a rock solid 75-80 fps, which is perfectly fine for a game like this. Survival games don't need absurdly high frame-rates; what's more important is certainly the frame times and consistency. And my game would rarely drop frames, it again stayed at 76-77 fps with little deviation.\n\n\tI think that's really this game in a nutshell. The first game, but with pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded and reworked in a positive way (for the most part). There's some reused sound FX throughout the game which I thought was a little disappointing, but there have to be some expectations with a team of just 30 people. People get wrapped up in the fact that visually it competes with triple-A games, but those same people forget a tiny team of 30 put this together, and they are only asking for 30 bucks, which is a steal for a game with this much visual fidelity and replayability. Not to mention the oncoming free updates that will only add more content. It's certainly okay to be critical of a product and point out its flaws, but with expectations in check, this comes out as a pretty solid game.",

A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day.

It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul.

      "Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10.

The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",
      "An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.",
      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.",
      "Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!",
      "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",
      "The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO.

      "Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.\n\nThere's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.",
      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either.

      "I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.",

My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8!

      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket.

Both games are very good.",
      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",

      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "*puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.",

      "I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in.

      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",

      "Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.

      "Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.",
      "Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.

      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",

      "When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.",
      "d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.",
      "Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.",
      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.",
      "OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD",
      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.",
      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.",
      "This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.",
      "Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning.

      "Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.",
      "What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise! Fun to wear if you are feeling oldschool)",

      "I own quite a bit of games on STEAM... but as I've gotten older I play here or there with my games for like 25 minutes, maybe 45 minutes, then move onto something else.  Gaming is more of a pleasant distraction these days at age 43.  I JUST SPENT 2 HOURS PLAYING ***HUNTDOWN***.  That like never happens anymore.  This game is simply amazing.  It's the Cyberpunk Action Game we all wanted 29 and 26 years ago but never got.  Think Elevator Action Returns (Part 2) meets Blood Dragon meets AD Police & Bubblegum Crisis Animes with a bitchin' soundtrack. Everything about this game from the 2D Pixel graphics to the music to the art is just amazing.  It's like someone hacked my brain and found my 14 year old self obsessed with William Gibson Sprawl novels of Cyberpunk meshed with Bladerunner.\n\nDon't hesitate to buy this game if you're a 2D freakazoid like me.  I could never really get into 3D (I play the games but never cared for it).  This is Phenomenal.",
      "I was just scrolling through cheap games. And then I found this. The art looked amazing so I gave it a shot. One of the best decision of my life. Several minutes into the game, A beautifully drawn sky full of stars greeted me, with a music that made you sink in the chill, starry night.\n\nYou can do good deeds, help others, give forgiveness.\n\nEverything in this game, from story, art, music, scenery, are all perfect and beautiful.\n\nThere are a lot of minigames too!\n\nDidn't expect a masterpiece like this for a damn LOW price as I purchased this on sale. That's why, if you're going to buy this game, buy the soundtrack and the artbook too while you're at it. Worth the price.",
      "The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)",
      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game.

Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game.

Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere. Characters and enemies are detailed and extremely varied in appearance.

So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through. As you progress through the game you will earn xp and levels which allow you to customise your characters skills giving a large variety of gameplay styles.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]The story in Borderlands 2 is rich and engaging. The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

      "This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.",
      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",
      "The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.",
      "I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.",
      "An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!",
      "I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one. \n\nDo yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.\nJust play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n",

      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.",
      "This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.",

      "Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences!

Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!",
      "Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",
      "Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai",
      "I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2.

      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",

      "This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.",

My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.",
      "[h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.",
      "This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.",
      "As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos.

If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.",
      "I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",
      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".",

      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10",
      "[H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n",

      "[b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",
      "I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.",
      "Bad game. The story is bad, the graphics are meh, gameplay is bad and there isnt any nudity unlike the first one (to be clear the game doesnt say it has nudity so whatever) but at the end of the day its just a really bad game regardless. I understand that having the mirror name doesnt require nudity but everything is just slapped hastily slapped together to make a finished game. I had really high hopes from the devs of mirror but this was a big letdown as this game has nothing going for it unlike the quality nsfw elements that the first game had as its strong point.\n\nIf you are a weeb and you like the move the slot type games its ok but otherwise no need to play.",

So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.",

This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny",
      "[b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",
      "I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^",
      "I love this franchise and NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4 really out did itself. I love the story line and everything eles they did with the game, BUT the MAIN problem i have with this is that even with my game pad I had to install another app so that I can use the dame pad. The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10. So sad.",

      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead. This is just my opinion.",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",
      "This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.",
      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10",
      "I have waited for this game for over a year, played the demo and realized it was even better. the only reason i haven't played more is because i'm about to pass out. \n\nthe game is a delightful visual and musical experience, setting the vibe really well, and the characters feel full of life. the main cast at least, with the amount of animations from swimming, attacking, climbing, fishing... there was a lot of love put into this.\n\nand if you aren't good at the game, or just want an easier time, theres easy tweaking your experience with relics. by the time i got to the earth wizard town, i could effectively triple my survivability and ensure a follow up. so if it looks interesting i encourage you to pick it up!\n\nan edit: 20 hours later. the game still has so much more, and it isn't afraid to deal with some stuff. this game isn't light fluff, but it's worth it",
      "Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.\n\nThere's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.",

      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "I've always been a little curious what a hero-centric world would look like from the eyes of a bystander. In theory it doesn't sound like a particularly exciting idea but there's a million and a half games where you are that hero, and I've never seen one where you aren't. As of the first chapter, I'm pretty interested in seeing how WP is going to take this story after having seen some adventurers through the eyes of a child that doesn't understand their way of life. \n\nThe story progresses by skipping to noteworthy events in her life as she gets older. She meets new people and is faced with decisions that shape her as a person. I'm not sure how to explain more of the story without getting into spoiling details, so I'll update this if I figure that out.\n\n--\n\nI really enjoyed World's Dawn and I'm very glad to see that he's not getting complacent with that and continuing to improve his skills. Storytelling is an art, and art doesn't improve without practice. I've waited a long time for this game to come out, and so far I'm not disappointed; and I doubt I will be.\n\nAlso, I'm happy to hear that WP's cancer is in remission and that he still wanted to go back to making games once he was feeling better. I hope he continues to produce these relaxing little escape-type games for a long time. Not every game needs a polished combat system and super high budget cg cut scenes to be fun.",
      "If you look past all of the stale \"The Cake Is A Lie\" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience.

The better you do, the better everyone does and visa versa. \n\nI love exploring to find new seeds, herbs, animals and materials... I actually find myself staying up until nearly 2am in game almost every day because of that. \n\nThe npcs seem to be an interesting bunch too, but I have to say that I've yet to see many events with them. This is something that I'm looking forward to though because the writing has been enjoyable so far too. \n\nIts my opinion that if you're an enjoyer of \"cozy\" games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Coral Island and  others like them, you'll likely enjoy Roots of Pacha as well.

Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",

She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",
      "This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.",
      "The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3"

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun. The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- Devs are on meth pricing this game at $44\n- To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Micromanage your 90%+ minority space colony simulator 2017\n\nSeriously, when choosing my starting colonists I had to reroll 15-20 times per colonist to get a white male colonist. It's almost like this game was made for Swedens' liberal party or something\n\n0/10 for feminista multi-kulti propaganda\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!\n- i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Awesome game. \n\nMy ex gave me this game.  We used to starve together, but now I starve alone. :'(\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- I genuinely had no expectations with Odyssey. Assassins Creed died along with Desmond for me. However, I was truly blown away with positivity for this installment of the series. Odyssey reminds me and takes a page from the Witcher 3. It's incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion more superior and engaging than Origins. That said, I couldn't get into Origins it wasn't for me.\n\nI've been a Assassins Creed fan ever since the first game. Over the years the game has evolved, adapted, and improved on every aspect up to Black Flag. I didn't feel the need to play the future installments after Black Flag. In my opinion they didn't fit in the mold of the series and I didn't support the actions Ubisoft were taking with the title. Odyssey changed my perspective on that with its fresh ideas and made me believe that a different direction isn't a bad one.\n\nI still miss my boy Ezio :(\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- [h1]An amazing sequel to Resident Evil 1.\n\nIncluding auto-saves, no more tedious door/room loading transitions, fluid movement controls, new weapons, enemies and more!\n\nThe character models and graphics are absolutely amazing!\nClaire lookin' pretty fire in the red jacket. Reminds you of Zoey from Left4Dead.\n(Although neither were modeled from each other, a total coincidence)\n\nDefinitely more fun than RE:1 in my opinion!\n\n10/10[/h1]\n- Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/\n- Just another pay to win city builder. If you like this kind of thing that's fine but I get rather bored waiting for the extremely slow build times. I'm not going to throw thousands of dollars on a game like this.\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- [h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]\n- Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.\n- Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards!

For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- This is Wario Land but fast. All the fortnite zoomers are gonna play this and talk about it like Fight Night Fungus ft. Frederick Leopold Fazbearington while nobody's gonna play the Wario Land games :(((( \n\nTLDR: Fire. Goku fortnite. My nuts hang :(\n- I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.\n\nGame of the year for everyone else? Maybe!\n\nLet me tell you some things about this game:\n+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)\n+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump\n+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design\n+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them\n+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you\n+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely\n+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area \"The City of Tears\" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive\n\nMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.\n\nFot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- [h1]Overall Score: 8.2 / 10[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][th]Quality[/th][th]9/10[/th][th]　 　 　Very high; well maintained[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Performance[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]No lags or crashes; short loading screens[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Utility[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Rare card mechanic bugs & BGM freezes\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Controls[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Simple point and click; controller support[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Gameplay[/th][th] 7.5/10[/th][th]　　　Casual Gwent RPG meets VN[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Challenge[/i][/td][td]7/10[/td][td][i]Tricky puzzles; very low default difficulty¹[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Content[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]35h incl. dialogues; no extra game modes[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Diversity[/i][/td][td] 6/10[/td][td][i]Neat scenarios; deck building is irrelevant[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Immersion[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Meaningful decisions & great atmosphere\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Design[/th][th]8/10[/th][th]　 　 　Great presentation overall[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Visuals[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Excellent, detailed artworks; minor flaws[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Sound[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]HQ voice-overs and SFX; epic soundtrack\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Texts²[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Decent story; deep lore; many documents[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Mapping[/i][/td][td] 4/10[/td][td][i]Plain 2D maps; no dungeons or buildings[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Interface[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Beautiful in-game menus; overall good UI\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n　¹☠️　I recommend to play on [b]Bonebreaker[/b] right away! \n\n　²🌱　Branching plot with 77 side quests & 20 endings.\n\n\n\n[u]Tested with:[/u]\n\n[strike]Low[/strike], [strike]Medium[/strike], High; 1080p, 60hz\nWindows 10 Professional, 64-Bit\nIntel ® Core™ i7-7700K, 4 x 4.2 GHz\nNvidia MSI GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X)\n16GB DDR4 RAM; old TOSHIBA HDD\nPS4, Xbox 360 & Xbox One Controller\n\n \n[i]If you found this review helpful, feel free to check out my...[/i]\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/27010538/]⭐ Curator page[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ggwpkkthxbye]👪 Steam group[/url] | [url=https://discord.gg/VbzybDY]👾 Discord[/url]\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n\n【グループB】\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.\n- Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.\n\nThere's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.

FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n- Instant uninstall after reading the privacy policy.\n\nShort version: \"We may collect any data we want (including sensible personal data) from the user and transmit it to anyone the laws allow us to. Also we may transmit your data to any foreign country where other (read: laxer) data protection laws may apply.\"\n\nUpon installation and booting up the game, the very first thing you will be asked to do is accept these conditions and enter your age so they can send it (together with other data) to third parties which will then show you \"appropriate\" advertisement ingame.\n\nYeah SEGA, aint no way I am saying yes to that. Uninstalled and refund requested.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in. I am super glad that I got this game from my friend. \n\nupside\n- Was well made from the start \n- developers are still working with the game and adding in new content when they can\n- Game you can play for hours if you are willing \n- Good strategy game \n\nsmall down sides \n-Not a city builder to me , so like not like sim city etc... more like a strategy game that involves having a small town ^^\n- Does take a bit to learn all the little mechanics but once you do , you are good to go \n-Still early access so from time to time you lose saves as they add content\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Have you ever asked yourself, \"Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?\"\n\nGuess what? It's your lucky day.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- ... and G*d said let there be Mushihimesama. An extremely accessible and satisfying bullet hell vertical shooter developed by Cave Interactive which debuted on the PS2 and has been ported to multiple systems.   The Steam version controls perfectly, plays almost perfectly and looks satisfactory given its age.\n\nThree modes; Novice (highly accessible for beginners), Normal, Arrange, Ver. 1.5 (dlc)\nThree sub modes for each mode; Original, Maniac, Ultra.\n\nMultiple scoring strategies and works with direct input and xinput controllers, \n\nFull compliment of Steam Features;\n[list]\n[*]Plenty of achievements\n[*]Cloud saving\n[*]Trading Cards \n[*]Leader-boards\n[*]Remote Play TV / Together.\n[/list]\n\nNot only is Mushihimesama a fantastic game to experience, instilling a let's do that again after every play-through, Mushihimesama bleeds Starship Trooper vibes.  A remarkable vertical shooter which all shooter fans must experience.\n- When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise! Fun to wear if you are feeling oldschool)\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- I own quite a bit of games on STEAM... but as I've gotten older I play here or there with my games for like 25 minutes, maybe 45 minutes, then move onto something else.  Gaming is more of a pleasant distraction these days at age 43.  I JUST SPENT 2 HOURS PLAYING ***HUNTDOWN***.  That like never happens anymore.  This game is simply amazing.  It's the Cyberpunk Action Game we all wanted 29 and 26 years ago but never got.  Think Elevator Action Returns (Part 2) meets Blood Dragon meets AD Police & Bubblegum Crisis Animes with a bitchin' soundtrack. Everything about this game from the 2D Pixel graphics to the music to the art is just amazing.  It's like someone hacked my brain and found my 14 year old self obsessed with William Gibson Sprawl novels of Cyberpunk meshed with Bladerunner.\n\nDon't hesitate to buy this game if you're a 2D freakazoid like me.  I could never really get into 3D (I play the games but never cared for it).  This is Phenomenal.\n- I was just scrolling through cheap games. And then I found this. The art looked amazing so I gave it a shot. One of the best decision of my life. Several minutes into the game, A beautifully drawn sky full of stars greeted me, with a music that made you sink in the chill, starry night.\n\nYou can do good deeds, help others, give forgiveness.\n\nEverything in this game, from story, art, music, scenery, are all perfect and beautiful.\n\nThere are a lot of minigames too!\n\nDidn't expect a masterpiece like this for a damn LOW price as I purchased this on sale. That's why, if you're going to buy this game, buy the soundtrack and the artbook too while you're at it. Worth the price.\n- The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- most overrated game to ever plague the front page of steam\n- [h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere.

So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through.

The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

Please leave me a comment[/i]\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.\n- I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one. \n\nDo yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.\nJust play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- + a faithful, thoughtful rendition of the trilogy\n+ looks great and runs gorgeously\n- claiming ultrawide support with pillarboxed cutscenes in a dialogue heavy game\n- EA launcher gets in the way\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- [h1]Overall Score: 8.2 / 10[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][th]Quality[/th][th]9/10[/th][th]　 　 　Very high; well maintained[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Performance[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]No lags or crashes; short loading screens[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Utility[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Rare card mechanic bugs & BGM freezes\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Controls[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Simple point and click; controller support[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Gameplay[/th][th] 7.5/10[/th][th]　　　Casual Gwent RPG meets VN[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Challenge[/i][/td][td]7/10[/td][td][i]Tricky puzzles; very low default difficulty¹[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Content[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]35h incl. dialogues; no extra game modes[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Diversity[/i][/td][td] 6/10[/td][td][i]Neat scenarios; deck building is irrelevant[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Immersion[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Meaningful decisions & great atmosphere\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Design[/th][th]8/10[/th][th]　 　 　Great presentation overall[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Visuals[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Excellent, detailed artworks; minor flaws[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Sound[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]HQ voice-overs and SFX; epic soundtrack\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Texts²[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Decent story; deep lore; many documents[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Mapping[/i][/td][td] 4/10[/td][td][i]Plain 2D maps; no dungeons or buildings[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Interface[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Beautiful in-game menus; overall good UI\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n　¹☠️　I recommend to play on [b]Bonebreaker[/b] right away! \n\n　²🌱　Branching plot with 77 side quests & 20 endings.\n\n\n\n[u]Tested with:[/u]\n\n[strike]Low[/strike], [strike]Medium[/strike], High; 1080p, 60hz\nWindows 10 Professional, 64-Bit\nIntel ® Core™ i7-7700K, 4 x 4.2 GHz\nNvidia MSI GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X)\n16GB DDR4 RAM; old TOSHIBA HDD\nPS4, Xbox 360 & Xbox One Controller\n\n \n[i]If you found this review helpful, feel free to check out my...[/i]\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/27010538/]⭐ Curator page[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ggwpkkthxbye]👪 Steam group[/url] | [url=https://discord.gg/VbzybDY]👾 Discord[/url]\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.\n- [h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos. This game is perfect for children who like to boast in the YouTube comments section about how they're smarter than everyone else because they get good grades in middle school and build elaborate structures in minecraft. If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

The multiplayer also leaves a lot to be desired.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- Devs are on meth pricing this game at $44\n- To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.\n- 1. What is \"Pyre\"?\nThe game \"Pyre\" was made by Supergiant Games and was released on the 25th of July in 2017. After \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" this is their third game. \"Pyre\" is an indie-action-rpg, which story is mostly told in form of a novel. The gameplay is very different to the experience you probably made in \"Bastion/Transistor\", which lead a few people to put a negative review on steam. Now you will no longer play as one single character like before, but you are responsible for a group of exiles. The gameplay at it´s heart can be declared as 3 parts:\n \npart 1 contains travelling/exploring the world\n\npart 2 contains social interactivity with your group (talking/trading/decision-making)\n\npart 3 contains to take part in the rites, that means a fast-paced action ball game (3 vs 3) without        a planning phase (like in \"Transistor\")\n\n\n2. Technical details\n-the game runs fine on my windows 10 64 bit machine and it needs about 8.2 gb space of your hard drive. Unfortunately the game runs bad on old machines, because you need about 4 gb ram to run it without an error (my other 3 gb ddr2-system couldn´t run it, I received a ram-error-message when starting the game).\n\n-controls with mouse+keyboard or gamepad are good and well implemented.\n\n\n3. What does the game do right?\n-great rpg-novel-mixture as a whole unique and emotional experience\n-despite the linear progression (mentioned \"phases/parts\" above) the game stays interesting enough to continue\n-a colourful and fantastic world to explore (no open-world)\n-great character-design and a good variety of different creatures, which affects the gameplay during the rites\n-beautiful artstyle with a lot of detail and smooth animations \n-believable and fleshed-out storyline (NOT \"black and white\") with a personalised ending! \n-wonderful soundtrack (mostly ambient)\n-the creatures of the world speak their own language, subtitle is displayed in old-fashioned English\n-rites: the thrilling-faced-paced-action-game has a lot of depth to it (skill tree/character selection/items/area of the rite)\n-selectable difficulty level (rites can be optionally restartet), which can be changed during the game (+ \"titan-mode\": advanced challenges you can add separately like in \"Bastion/Transistor\")\n-meaningful and emotional decisions to be made (I´m looking at you mass effect), thankfully there are no dead-ends but different endings (personalised!)\n-\"Pyre\" is \"2-3 times\" longer compared to \"Bastion\"/\"Transistor\" without getting boring\n-good mouse+keyboard and gamepad support\n-\"versus-mode\": you can play against friends together on your pc or alone against CPU (with all the characters in the game!)\n\n\n4. What does the game do wrong?\n-the fast-paced-gameplay during the rites can be very fast and too stressful at times (I experienced some unfair situations here and there)\n-controls are sometimes not precise enough, especially when the gameplay is getting hot\n-hardware requirements (like \"Transistor\") with 4 gb ddr-ram are over the top regarding old rigs with dual-core cpu´s \n-some minor bugs during the rites (ball gets stuck, switching between characters over distance, bad camera angles over distance)\n-\"versus mode\" can only be played as local multiplayer\n-no bonus material for fans at all \n\n\n5. tl;dr\nPyre offers a fantastic but linear action-rpg-experience with a great story, which is told in form of a novel with a personalised ending. The gameplay is a mixture of exploration, social interactivity and a 3 vs 3 ball-sports-game. The level of creativity considering world-building, character design, music and the way the story is being told is on an insanely high level. If you liked \"Bastion\" and \"Transistor\" you need to know that you don´t play just as one character anymore. But what you can expect is a game with a heart, just like their games before. Pyre is in my opinion a masterpiece and the best Supergiant game so far.\n\n\n6. Final thoughts\nAs a child of the 80´s I played a lot of pc games. Sometimes I look back and remember how I bought game boxes from a company called \"Lucas Arts\". There were times I didn´t even inform myself about the upcoming games, I just bought them because I loved their games I purchased before. For me Supergiant reached that status in the present time. \n\n\n\nUntil the stars align!\nIf you liked this review be sure to hit the like button to help other players with helpful reviews. Thanks!\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Micromanage your 90%+ minority space colony simulator 2017\n\nSeriously, when choosing my starting colonists I had to reroll 15-20 times per colonist to get a white male colonist. It's almost like this game was made for Swedens' liberal party or something\n\n0/10 for feminista multi-kulti propaganda\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!\n- i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Awesome game. \n\nMy ex gave me this game.  We used to starve together, but now I starve alone. :'(\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- [i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- I genuinely had no expectations with Odyssey. Assassins Creed died along with Desmond for me. However, I was truly blown away with positivity for this installment of the series. Odyssey reminds me and takes a page from the Witcher 3. It's incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion more superior and engaging than Origins. That said, I couldn't get into Origins it wasn't for me.\n\nI've been a Assassins Creed fan ever since the first game. Over the years the game has evolved, adapted, and improved on every aspect up to Black Flag. I didn't feel the need to play the future installments after Black Flag. In my opinion they didn't fit in the mold of the series and I didn't support the actions Ubisoft were taking with the title. Odyssey changed my perspective on that with its fresh ideas and made me believe that a different direction isn't a bad one.\n\nI still miss my boy Ezio :(\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- Early Access Review:\nPros: \n- Hilarious flavor text in the form of Books and Proverbs. Seriously, someone took a lot of time creating all that.\n- Really enjoyable music\n- Beautiful pixel art\n- Engaging and interesting story\n- Overall very fun introduction to a huge world\n- Highly responsive dev team that's not only advacing on completion of the game but actively listens to their already large community of players\n- There's a lot of secrets and things to do that you might run out of time to do before the end of the year deadline. You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)\n- [h1]An amazing sequel to Resident Evil 1.\n\nIncluding auto-saves, no more tedious door/room loading transitions, fluid movement controls, new weapons, enemies and more!\n\nThe character models and graphics are absolutely amazing!\nClaire lookin' pretty fire in the red jacket. Reminds you of Zoey from Left4Dead.\n(Although neither were modeled from each other, a total coincidence)\n\nDefinitely more fun than RE:1 in my opinion!\n\n10/10[/h1]\n- Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- Great game... who need 1 or 2 years of development. tl;dr: mid game turn into a micromanagment hell.\n\nThe game is fantastic until a certain point. You start as a mercenary, one party, 50-150 soldiers doing missions, small battles or bigger fights joining armies. Good graphics, brutal engagments with 200-1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle, playing as a soldier is a blast.\n\nThe problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family, the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime. You have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues. When your lords get captured & escapes, they'll go into a random town until you pick em again, then you'll have to reform the party. Same with caravanes for trading, if they get captured, you'll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan. You have to partially fill towns with soldiers, manually, from your own soldiers. All the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle, as you can't delegate. Messengers are not a thing.\n\nYou can't manage a town at a distance, you can't tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory, they do whatever they want if they're out of your army / party, so you have to do it yourself. Either you're leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game, or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight... with various success. Some commanders are pretty good, other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry. Protip: don't be a recruit in an imperial army.\n\nYou can't tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers, it's up to you, or the IA if it feel like it. Worst, if you let the parties you created roam around (parties = group of 70-200 soldiers under a lord) they can be (temporarily) drafted in other armies of your kingdom... and you'll have to physically move to the army, talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back. Of course, large armies are slow. This leads the the next problem, swarms.\n\nMy worst fear is not a massive army, it's an army disbanded in the middle of my territory. The small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army. Raided villages impact your town / castle loyalty and gold quite heavily. Sure, you could disband your army and hunt them yourself... but that makes you take a step back, and all your parties would reform under another army you can't control. And man, some army commanders are really, really stupid. Verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers, cavalry in a forest vs pikemens, you name it. I can't count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army. But let's say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages.\n\nThe capture system is broken. Captured lords escape A LOT. I had some escape 20 seconds after being captured. They never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days. Once they escape, they magically teleport to their hometown, rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages. AI \"cheat\" with recruits, they will always find soldiers in town, even if they're empty for you. Executions you say?\n\nIf you execute a lord, no matter how much of an A-hole he/she is, the whole faction will hate you. He raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants? Still not good enough. You just can't kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line, and you'll need those lords to be friendly later. Worth to mention, capturing the leader of a faction won't stop a war.\n\nLast - peace / war is on/off. I had 600 days of continuous war, followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map (due to a bug apparently), and i'm now back at 300 days of war. Not a single day of peace, when one war stop another start immediatly. They will just never, ever stop fighting. Can't catch a breath, can't leave the front of your lose towns.\n\nOh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so.\n\nI would still recommand the game, it's really fun for a while but it need a HUGE QoL update.\n\n- First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- If you somehow don't know what this is: It's a meta-narrative focused walking sim with a funny narrator. Only you know if that kind of thing sounds like a good time to you.\n\nSubtract about 26 hours from my playtime because I'm a lunatic who left the game running for a whole day to get a silly achievement.\n\nI loved the HD remix (never played the og mod), and I really liked this one too, but I will say that a lot of the commentary the original offered doesn't hit as hard or hold up as well almost a decade later, just because the narrative structure and how narrative is tied to gameplay of many story-driven games has changed in that time (because of course it has), as well as the mindset of a lot of players being different. So I think that it's worth keeping in mind the cultural moment the original was made during... if you're the thinky type who likes to overthink things. You massive nerd.\n\nStill, it felt nice to jump back in and spend a little more time with the narrator, and there were some legitimately striking moments in the new content that I found to be quite powerful and engaging. Overall, though, having played the original, getting all the new stuff (and revisiting the old) felt a lot more like checking off a to-do list than active exploration teasing at the boundaries of the game and it's layout than the first one.\n- The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/\n- Just another pay to win city builder. If you like this kind of thing that's fine but I get rather bored waiting for the extremely slow build times. I'm not going to throw thousands of dollars on a game like this.\n- This game is for sure not perfect, but worth buying for a specific type of gamer.\n\n[b]What is good in this game?[/b]\n- It has a pretty solid gun gameplay. The movement is quick and polished as well.\n- One level is on average 20 seconds. It's fun to improve your gameplay to get better times in the small levels. \n- It's really a blast getting a perfect run, killing enemies in bullet time or exploiting the enemies weakspots.\n- There is content for around 10-15 hours. Maybe more if you consider going for 100%.\n\n[b]Anyway there are also some flaws: [/b]\n- In Neon White or Ghostrunner the movement and pace through the levels often feels like a perfect choreographic \"dance\"\n- The levels and the areas in Warstride are verry tight. I often lost pace through \"stupid\" placed rocks or small doors.\n- There is not much to explore. The levels are verry linear. While in Neon White it was so much fun to explore shortcuts or other hidden possibilities to improve ur time there are no such mechanics in Warstride at all. I'd love to have some exploration at least in the \"long levels\".\n- It could get repetitive for some players as it's a core element to complete the levels on 5 different difficulties. \n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nIf you like fast paced games like Ghostrunner, Neon White or Doom and you have no problem in repeating short levels several times and u don't except an extraordinary game u will have fun for several hours on a low price.\n\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- [h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]\n- Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.\n- Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2017: Game released\n* 2018: I have no money to buy\n* 2019: Mixture feeling about this game\n* 2020: Overall, Wolfenstein the New Order is much fun to play\n* 2023: Very fun to replay :D\n\n🟢 = Available +1\n🔴 = Not available -1\n\n[h1]         EXPECTATION CHECKLIST:[/h1] \n🟢 Mature contents\n🟢 Exciting gunplay\n🟢 Dual weilding weapons at same time\n🟢 Score Attack for replay value\n🟢 Stealth play\n🔴 Standard menu screen design\n🔴 Charming characters\n🔴 Full action pack cutscene in every chapter\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Mostly Positive  [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1640917196998422339/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B+} Worth a play, if you enjoy Exciting gunplay with Mature Contents.

For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- This is Wario Land but fast. All the fortnite zoomers are gonna play this and talk about it like Fight Night Fungus ft. Frederick Leopold Fazbearington while nobody's gonna play the Wario Land games :(((( \n\nTLDR: Fire. Goku fortnite. My nuts hang :(\n- I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- Shoot first ask questions later, like real life. Maybe pepper spray a pregnant woman.\n- RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- [h1]An old classic that's fresher than lots of today's titles.[/h1]\n\n[i]Day of the Tentacle[/i] first launched in 1993. I remember, because I was a teenager then and couldn't play it as my PC didn't meet the minimum requirements! This was actually the sequel to an earlier game, [i]Maniac Mansion[/i], which was released in 1987. I played [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] a few years after it came out, but did not complete it as the game's movement and controls were just too dated and clunky for me (even back then) to be bothered with. \n\nPlaying [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] is not at all necessary in order to enjoy [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], though those who have will definitely find greater connection to the game's characters, especially the Edison family.\n\n23 years later, [i]Day of the Tentacle Remastered[/i] is essentially the same as it was before, but with sleeker graphics and a more modernised interface. While the story hasn't changed, it surprisingly (or not) hasn't aged one bit either - tentacle mutates and seeks to conquer the world, and only you (and your friends) can stop him! Though straightforward, the game's charm is in its various amusing time travel locations and the weird and wonderful characters you meet along the way. This is a prime example of where [i]\"it's all about the journey, not the destination.\"[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Yays![/h1]\n\n+ Vibrant, colourful, hi-res cartoon-style graphics.\n+ Well-designed rooms, locations and scenery.\n+ Fully voiced, with good voice acting for the most part. (The guy who plays Dr Fred is awesome.)\n+ Interesting, memorable characters.\n+ Fun, amusing story.\n+ Wacky humour.\n+ Clear goals.\n+ Cool easter eggs. (Under \"achievements\".)\n+ Contains a free game ([i]Maniac Mansion[/i])!\n+ Puzzles are mostly enjoyable and require some creative thinking.\n+ Many gameplay hours.\n+ Trading cards.\n\n[h1]Nays.[/h1]\n\n- [url=steamcommunity.com/app/388210/discussions/0/392184522713202518/]Audio starts stuttering[/url] after a while, due to memory problems.\n- Achievements remain hidden, even after the game is completed, so you can't see what you're missing.\n- Some puzzles have illogical or nonsensical solutions.\n- Bugs: e.g. When looking at one of the items, Laverne's voice sounds when Bernard speaks.\n- No mouse command to fast-forward dialogue; instead, you have to press \".\" which is really inconvenient, especially when the whole point of a point-n-click game is to [i]not[/i] have to use your keyboard!\n- Some counter-intuitive puzzle set-ups: E.g. For the videotape puzzle, a button which looks like the \"STOP\" button, is actually the \"RECORD\" button. Anyone who's ever used a VCR or tape recorder would know that the square symbol denotes \"STOP\", while the round button denotes \"RECORD\". \n- Hoagie's periodic belches sound absolutely disgusting!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThis was a hugely enjoyable experience from start to finish. Though the nostalgia factor played a part in my case, even if you've never heard of the [i]Maniac Mansion[/i] series, as long as you count yourself a point-n-click adventure game fan, this is a must-play because it just gets so many things right. Add to that the timeless plot and wacky characters, and you have yourself a game that will play just as fresh & new decades down the road.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][u]Disclaimer:[/u] [i]Game played for free, with many thanks to my dear friend [url=steamcommunity.com/id/kflorence]KFlo[/url]. :)[/i][/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.\n\nGame of the year for everyone else? Maybe!\n\nLet me tell you some things about this game:\n+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)\n+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump\n+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design\n+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them\n+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you\n+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely\n+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area \"The City of Tears\" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive\n\nMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.\n\nFot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- POTENTIAL SPOILERS \n\n\n\nSome guy came to me asking for mercy, gave me $20 and gave me a digital watch and asked me to let him in for the love of god, I arrested him.\n\nI let a prostitute get enslaved because I felt like it.\n\nI've ruined more marraiges than Monopoly.\n\nI've made a deal with a group of terrorists.\n\nI put poison on a random dudes passport and got him killed, along with another soldier.\n\nI got shot in the face in front of my own family.\n\nI'm only 3 hours into the game.\n\n\n\n10/10 \"It's okay\", \"Like Skyrim with guns\"\n\nDid I mention I killed Biker from Hotline Miami?\n- This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- [h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.\n- you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- [h1]Overall Score: 8.2 / 10[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][th]Quality[/th][th]9/10[/th][th]　 　 　Very high; well maintained[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Performance[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]No lags or crashes; short loading screens[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Utility[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Rare card mechanic bugs & BGM freezes\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Controls[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Simple point and click; controller support[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Gameplay[/th][th] 7.5/10[/th][th]　　　Casual Gwent RPG meets VN[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Challenge[/i][/td][td]7/10[/td][td][i]Tricky puzzles; very low default difficulty¹[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Content[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]35h incl. dialogues; no extra game modes[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Diversity[/i][/td][td] 6/10[/td][td][i]Neat scenarios; deck building is irrelevant[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Immersion[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Meaningful decisions & great atmosphere\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Design[/th][th]8/10[/th][th]　 　 　Great presentation overall[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Visuals[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Excellent, detailed artworks; minor flaws[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Sound[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]HQ voice-overs and SFX; epic soundtrack\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Texts²[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Decent story; deep lore; many documents[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Mapping[/i][/td][td] 4/10[/td][td][i]Plain 2D maps; no dungeons or buildings[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Interface[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Beautiful in-game menus; overall good UI\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n　¹☠️　I recommend to play on [b]Bonebreaker[/b] right away! \n\n　²🌱　Branching plot with 77 side quests & 20 endings.\n\n\n\n[u]Tested with:[/u]\n\n[strike]Low[/strike], [strike]Medium[/strike], High; 1080p, 60hz\nWindows 10 Professional, 64-Bit\nIntel ® Core™ i7-7700K, 4 x 4.2 GHz\nNvidia MSI GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X)\n16GB DDR4 RAM; old TOSHIBA HDD\nPS4, Xbox 360 & Xbox One Controller\n\n \n[i]If you found this review helpful, feel free to check out my...[/i]\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/27010538/]⭐ Curator page[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ggwpkkthxbye]👪 Steam group[/url] | [url=https://discord.gg/VbzybDY]👾 Discord[/url]\n- The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface. And you may be the last human alive anywhere. And if your drones die, you're next.\n\nSo on the balance, it's mostly bad news.\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- Pros:\n\n+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder\n\n+Built in modding tools\n\n+Beautiful Graphics\n\n+It's challanging (learning curve)\n\n+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements\n\n+Lots of replayability\n\nCons:\n\n-takes over your life\n\n***\n\nSpecs that are below the minimum requirements:\n\n2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)\n\nAMD Radeon HD 8400 video card ( nVIDIA GeForce GTX 260, 512 MB  or ATI Radeon HD 5670, 512 MB is the minimum)\n\nEverything else is above the minimum required.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla. But I'm still recommending it because steam doesn't allow maybes, and there's very little competition for this niche of VN.\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n\n【グループB】\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.\n- Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.\n- Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.\n\nThere's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- I shall start by saying that if you are deciding to buy this game then don't let the negative reviews sway you. In general, Fallout 4 is an amazing game and can be incredibly fun.\n\nPros: \n-Very immersive and will drain so many hours, days, weeks and months from your life.\n-Far Harbour, Automotron and (first half of) NukaWorld DLC have really good stories, quests and environments.\n-Mostly fluid combat system. Everything depends on how you want to play the game.\n\nCons: \n-WIll drain so much of your life away (might've forgotten my gf's birthday ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ )\n-Main story was incredibly lackluster compared to previous Fallout games\n-Giving you the option to be literally any kind of character you want to be....except you're always tied to being a parent.\n-a few repitive quests. (although gives you opportunities to approach these quests, areas and enemies differently\n\nAll in all, If you're a Fallout fan because of previous stories then you might not feel fulfilled playing this game, however if you love character creations, lore and immersive environments with untold stories then I completely recommend this game to you.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- You can do anything in this game. Spawn a ton of teletubbies and grab a nuke to blow them up? You can do that. Get a gun and kill your friends? You can do that. Fly around? You can do that. Anything? You can do that.\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n- Life is Norway sure is Strange huh :)\nAs you can see the game has a low poly artstyle, which I normally don't much like, but here it looks extremely good, especially when the camera zooms out to show more of the landscape.\nDefinitely also check out the dev's other game, Milkmaid of the Milky Way. Both games are very good.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.

Oh, you can also decide to let her remain a prisoner; choosing to do essentially nothing is still a choice.\n\nIt ends with a question: who is she?  Also, who are you?  More importantly, what are you to one another?\n\nThis review also ends with a question: \"Should you buy this game?\" and an answer: \"Hell yes, you should!\"\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- 🎃 Tя!cked not Tяeated 🎃 full price $29.99 you can only play a 10 min Light Version. I had hoped that was a joke? I tried Steam \"Offline\" mode still blocked me from Full Monty 18+ XP Room 👎🏻\n\nSteam Refunded 😩 see discussions click 💭 icon\n\n⚪️ $29.99 is greedy money grab for no sex play content.\n⚪️ We can't get anyone to answer back how we buy 18+ Version.\n⚪️ I can see from the Web Site they have a Mobile VR Truck just for Sensual VR and look to now be renting rooms in popular restaurants around Germany. \n\nI honestly believe until the DEV's of this game have fully exhausted it's Euro revenue stream from VR Room Rentals and VR Mobile Truck. They will not sell us the public it's 18+ XP Room from it's Web Site.  \n\nNote to Publisher: Anything less than changing this to a Free Demo from all the above I've stated.  Then you don't belong on steam store.\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n- Instant uninstall after reading the privacy policy.\n\nShort version: \"We may collect any data we want (including sensible personal data) from the user and transmit it to anyone the laws allow us to. Also we may transmit your data to any foreign country where other (read: laxer) data protection laws may apply.\"\n\nUpon installation and booting up the game, the very first thing you will be asked to do is accept these conditions and enter your age so they can send it (together with other data) to third parties which will then show you \"appropriate\" advertisement ingame.\n\nYeah SEGA, aint no way I am saying yes to that. Uninstalled and refund requested.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- An amazing achievement. It's so beautiful.\n\nSilence the music, keep the sound effects on, and turn on a yacht rock playlist. Fade into neon, baby.\n- I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in. I am super glad that I got this game from my friend. \n\nupside\n- Was well made from the start \n- developers are still working with the game and adding in new content when they can\n- Game you can play for hours if you are willing \n- Good strategy game \n\nsmall down sides \n-Not a city builder to me , so like not like sim city etc... more like a strategy game that involves having a small town ^^\n- Does take a bit to learn all the little mechanics but once you do , you are good to go \n-Still early access so from time to time you lose saves as they add content\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- Absolutely the second best (half-life Alyx is the best game) VR game I have played in the last 5+ years.  Both RM1 and RM2 are fantastic, superb graphics, excellent story and game play.  I took my time and explored and the game time ended up just over 13 hours.  But the big diff is this game was developed by a very small non-AAA team while Half life Alyx was created with a large AAA dev team with unlimited budget.  The quality/game play of recently released VR games has been exceptionally poor and very disappointing to say the least.  But NOT THIS GAME, RED MATTER 2 excels in every area and is simply a great game that will keep you playing.     \n\nI played using Vive Pro 1 wireless with vive wands and had no issues with controllers or my HMD.  I am saddened that the game play for me is over now that I beat the game......i really enjoyed playing this game and can only hope that Vertical Robot will soon release another similar game........or MAYBE RM3!\n\nGREAT WORK DEVS..........this game must be selected as game of the year!\n- Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Have you ever asked yourself, \"Man, why doesn't someone make a cooperative fantasy RPG with all the nifty RPG-ism's that I love, like skills and talents and crafting and that I can play at my own pace with my friend and we can decide how we complete quests and treat people in the world and if we disagree then there was a mechanic in place that supported that and NPC characters we could hire and have join our adventures and instead of mindlessly blasting through hundreds of monsters like every other action RPG out there, we could fight in some nail-biting tactical, turn-based combat with spells and abilities that would affect the environment and turn the tide of the battle and the whole thing is wrapped up in a fantastic looking package with great looking characters and animations and some genuinely good and at times humorous writing?\"\n\nGuess what? It's your lucky day.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- Did you lost faith in parkur adventure, horror and stealth genres? Did you lost hope to see realistic, immersive and HARCORE AAA game without press x to win killstreaks and cluttering UI? Outlast will restore your faith in everything mentioned and game industy! It also will prove you that indie team of 10 men can do AAA-Indie titles without greedy publishers that killing their creative freedom and forcing them to make a Call of Duty and Gears of War accessible for wider re-tar-ded audience. No no no, this game is not accessible to wide audience, it will scare shit out of most players not only because its good horror, but also because it realistic and hardcore stealth just like Thief was and its damn hard for braindead Call of Duty Xbox 360 generation, thats why its damn pleasant for old school gamers such as me who loved realism and challenge in older games before its almost gone from modern games.\nIf you love hard chellenge, innovative, realistc and purely immersive games such as Alone in Dark 2008, and if you hate YOBA call of duty style FPS games, you will love this one! If you love true surival horrors where survival is very hard because you cant even fight back, and if you love Amnesia you will love this game as well, and if you love old Splinter Cell up to Chaos Theory and loved Thief and remember that scarry part in catacomb,  you will love this game too!\nI love this game, its not perfect however, but its almos what i dreamed about for many years. Oh yeah, did i tell you that its one of rare games with full body awareness and every action in game totally animated?\n\nWhat you waiting for ? BUY THIS GAME ALREADY! I cost twice cheaper than most of recent Mediocre AAA games like Tomb Raider 2013, Bioshock Infinite, Resident Evil 6, Splinter Cell Blacklist, Call of Duty BO2, Metro Las Light, Far Cry, Assassin's Creed 3 and so on, but it brings more fun and joy than all of them together. Before this game 2013 year was a year of dissapointment (if you count only AAA type of games), but Outlast  game changed it for me! 10 men can do job better than over 100 men in big companies, and glory of  this game puts all big companies to shame! \n\nAnd a bonus: no precut DLC, no season passes, no achivements and stupid unlocks that turns game intro retarded grind, and most importan -  this game is MOD-FRIENDLY and allows to tweak AI and Difficulty a lot, nothing locked, and critical patches was released just next day after bugs was reported! Trully oldschool PC-specific way of doing business with respect to customers!\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- ... and G*d said let there be Mushihimesama. An extremely accessible and satisfying bullet hell vertical shooter developed by Cave Interactive which debuted on the PS2 and has been ported to multiple systems.   The Steam version controls perfectly, plays almost perfectly and looks satisfactory given its age.\n\nThree modes; Novice (highly accessible for beginners), Normal, Arrange, Ver. 1.5 (dlc)\nThree sub modes for each mode; Original, Maniac, Ultra.\n\nMultiple scoring strategies and works with direct input and xinput controllers, \n\nFull compliment of Steam Features;\n[list]\n[*]Plenty of achievements\n[*]Cloud saving\n[*]Trading Cards \n[*]Leader-boards\n[*]Remote Play TV / Together.\n[/list]\n\nNot only is Mushihimesama a fantastic game to experience, instilling a let's do that again after every play-through, Mushihimesama bleeds Starship Trooper vibes.  A remarkable vertical shooter which all shooter fans must experience.\n- When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!\nFun to control, it runs fine on my potato Laptop\nIts colorful\nits fun\nits amazingly well animated\ni love the map, i love the bosses so far, i love everythign about this,\nlock on aiming with RB is awesome, special weapons, parries, and attacks you buy from the shop ^^ this is \nPURE GOLD\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either. Recommended.\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.\n- This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- What a refreshing experience, returning to Ishimura yet again, but with a nice new coat of paint!\nAfter so many years, we finally got a \"new\" Dead Space game, and surprisingly, they actually delivered! \n\nThere are some differences in story and other details, but honestly I think it was all tastefully done.\nThe gameplay borrows from the games after Dead Space 1, like being able to TK enemies with spikes and their claws properly, along with stomping for loot!\n\nThere are also some new differences, like new side missions for extra story, and being able to return and explore areas you have previously been to, which I think was a wonderful addition.\n\nThere were a few small issues occasionally, I imagine with time these may be touched upon, but mainly it was fps hitching when loading new areas sometimes, and very rare crashes (I crashed twice through the entire playthrough)\n\nOtherwise I kept a stable fps for most of the game on Ultra settings, and didn't really experience any other issues (RTX 2080)\n\nIt really was just overall a great singleplayer experience for one of my favorite franchises, and I hope this will do well enough, so we can see more Dead Space in the near future from now on! \n\nGreat game, beautiful visuals, and wonderful experience, for any Dead Space fan. \n\n(Also small side note, you receive the original Dead Space (2008) suit upon visiting your stores inventory, which is a very welcoming surprise! Fun to wear if you are feeling oldschool)\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- I own quite a bit of games on STEAM... but as I've gotten older I play here or there with my games for like 25 minutes, maybe 45 minutes, then move onto something else.  Gaming is more of a pleasant distraction these days at age 43.  I JUST SPENT 2 HOURS PLAYING ***HUNTDOWN***.  That like never happens anymore.  This game is simply amazing.  It's the Cyberpunk Action Game we all wanted 29 and 26 years ago but never got.  Think Elevator Action Returns (Part 2) meets Blood Dragon meets AD Police & Bubblegum Crisis Animes with a bitchin' soundtrack. Everything about this game from the 2D Pixel graphics to the music to the art is just amazing.  It's like someone hacked my brain and found my 14 year old self obsessed with William Gibson Sprawl novels of Cyberpunk meshed with Bladerunner.\n\nDon't hesitate to buy this game if you're a 2D freakazoid like me.  I could never really get into 3D (I play the games but never cared for it).  This is Phenomenal.\n- I was just scrolling through cheap games. And then I found this. The art looked amazing so I gave it a shot. One of the best decision of my life. Several minutes into the game, A beautifully drawn sky full of stars greeted me, with a music that made you sink in the chill, starry night.\n\nYou can do good deeds, help others, give forgiveness.\n\nEverything in this game, from story, art, music, scenery, are all perfect and beautiful.\n\nThere are a lot of minigames too!\n\nDidn't expect a masterpiece like this for a damn LOW price as I purchased this on sale. That's why, if you're going to buy this game, buy the soundtrack and the artbook too while you're at it. Worth the price.\n- The classic just keeps getting better year after year.\n\nFor those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. \n\nIf you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying \"but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?\"  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  \n\nA must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)\n- This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.\n- most overrated game to ever plague the front page of steam\n- [h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere.

Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text). [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]For me, this game remains simply the best cooperative multiplayer experiences you can have. Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAslo Free DLC (until the 8th July)  \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/872280\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended]More reviews by Fancy Fish[/url]\n[i]Agree / Disagree? Please leave me a comment[/i]\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- The Swords of Ditto has all the elements needed to be a fantastic game. The world design and art is delightful, the combat is fine, the weapons are fun and interesting, and the world generation is surprisingly solid.\n\nUnfortunately, some poor design choices kill the pacing.\n\nEvery time you die, you need to go through the same tedious routine. Listen to the guide character slowly talk to you, slowly run through a handful of empty screens, grab your sword, stop in town to check in and get your bearings, then grind up enough experience killing random bad guys with just your generic sword until you can start the first dungeon.\n\nOnce you finish the first dungeon and get a special weapon, that's when the game really comes into its own and starts feeling fun. But it just takes way too long to get to that point. While the sword is fine, being stuck with only it over and over again for long periods of time just isn't very exciting. The game's time limit itself isn't a problem, just that you spend so much of each 'life' building up to the good part. \n\nThe game tries to alleviate that problem by having two currencies. One lets you buy stuff for your current life, and the other lets you keep things for your next life. The problem is, you accumulate these currencies way too slowly and they carry over from one life to the next. Consequently, you CAN start with a bunch of advantages, but it feels like it's a huge investment. And if you screw up, that means you'll have to spend another few lives pretty much just grinding up currency to get another shot at a 'good' life.\n\nThese problems end up creating an experience that's just way too repetitive and tedious to recommend.\n\n\nPerhaps what's most frustrating, though, is that there are simple solutions to these problems. If the game simply made accumulating currency much faster and NOT carry over to the next life (thus encouraging you to spend it regularly on fun upgrades and be able to start each life with a special weapon) and did away with having to grind to start the first dungeon, it would be great! Honestly, that's really the only change needed to make this game great.\n\nIf there was ever a game that should have spent a couple months in Early Access before releasing, this was it. I sincerely hope the devs tweak the pacing and I can come back in a few months and turn this review positive.\n- I don't like rogue-likes ( or rogue-lites). Don't get me wrong, I've tried! I'll buy some well-reviewed game like Enter the Gungeon, boot it up, play for an hour or two, then let it sit in my library until time immemorial. It's a cycle I was loath to repeat which is why despite enjoying the rest of Supergiant's games I stayed away from Hades for about a year.\n\nThis is not like other rogue-likes.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of reviews about Supergiant's signature visuals, rocking soundtrack, and tight combat( or about how Cerberus is a good boy). These are all true, and if you already like the rogue-like genre should sell you on this game, but if you're like me that's not enough. The reason I've played more of this game than any other rogue-like is because of Supergiant's ability to combine story and gameplay. In a lesser game, picking up a powerup consists of a menu screen or a short visual cue, but in Hades picking a boon means learning more about the crazy gods on mount olympus. Is Poseidon jealous of Zeus? Does Athena resent Ares? Is Dionysis drunk?  You'll get to experience all of these little dramas and more as you progress through a run, but where Hades really sets itself apart from the rest of genre is what happens after a run. \n\nDying in Hades isn't like losing, it's like coming home. \n\nYou'll get to check in on all of the characters in the masters house, from hypnos the sleepy doorman, your mentor Achilles, to mother night herself. Not to mention the adorable house-keeper. Sometimes it's not about Zagreus, but the relationships all of these colorful characters have which each other which will develop over each failure as you return to the house of Hades. Afterwards I can unlock new weapons (or weapon aspects), new powerups, or see the new items I've collected and prepare for my next run. It's a thoroughly satisfying loop, so even if you don't think this is your type of game, you should give it a shot.\n- An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!\n- I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one. \n\nDo yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.\nJust play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- + a faithful, thoughtful rendition of the trilogy\n+ looks great and runs gorgeously\n- claiming ultrawide support with pillarboxed cutscenes in a dialogue heavy game\n- EA launcher gets in the way\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Yeah sooooo I went 1k words past the max...had to pare this down...it's ok...I'm mentally stable...\n\nCrossCode is a top-notch indie in its genre. I'd mention it in the same breath as Celeste, Hades, and Outer Wilds. (guess I just did.) If you can at least enjoy both puzzles and real-time combat, this game is for you; it's not as much of a JRPG as it might look. The only real flaw I care to levy is that it isn’t incredible out of the gate; it’s merely good, and gets much better. I was going to summarize my reactions and add a \"what is the premise/gameplay loop\" section and have longer sections but I had to cut it all out so have _/5 ratings on the section titles instead. It's fine. I'm fine. Everything is fine.\n\nOk, review time.\n\nSTORY 4/5 NEATO\n\nThe story is great, and not quite what you might expect. It starts pretty light and cozy, with solid (and often meta) humor interspersed with cryptic moments. I like how casually the in-universe MMO is treated by the players. I enjoyed all the characters, including our mostly-mute but personable Lea. Once it ramps up, the story takes some exciting turns, too; the devs really know how to do drama without doing overdrama. I didn't relate too much to the story but I think it was told quite well. I like the portrayal of the antagonists for the most part, though I wish I could have felt their presence more often. The lore is also fascinating, if occasionally hard to grasp because the line between real and virtual is very thin due to the game’s particular premise. (The difference between real people and NPCs is sometimes unclear, for instance.) The ending was good, but I think the DLC epilogue wraps the game up far better.\n\nCOMBAT 5/5 WOWIE\n\nWhen you start out, combat feels almost hack-n-slashy. You can spam melee attacks and bullets for days, but you also have a charged projectile, a dodge-dash, and a shield. The elemental modes are absolutely the highlight due to the way enemies work, and the sort of limiter gauge they have forces strategy. Special moves are stylish and borderline absurd at higher levels. A huge skill tree controls them and much more; unlike some skill trees, this one requires choices, which is always a good sign. Oh and consumables are your main source of healing and buffs, and they aren't overpowered! Balancing win.\n\nThe enemies are really what make the combat fantastic. Almost every enemy has at least one gimmick and one visible weakness. The stun gauge mechanic is vital to all battles, forcing you to exploit those weaknesses to stun enemies and give you time to use your extra-long special moves. Bosses love to give you iterative micro-puzzles to fill their stun gauges, while minibosses are comfortably in-between. Bosses commonly have armor or invulnerability when not stunned, forcing even overleveled players to figure out the micro-puzzles to hit hard. (More great balancing.) Most weaknesses involve the element system, eventually encouraging you to swap elements multiple times mid-fight. The micro-puzzles will build on what you’ve been learning in a dungeon if it’s a dungeon fight. I'll mention that some normal enemies do feel like damage sponges at first, but you'll get used to this; the simple enemy design in the early game makes it seem worse than it is imo.\n\nPUZZLES 5/5 FUN COOL\n\nFor puzzles you've got your common environmental \"platforming\" puzzles, your specialized quest puzzles, your dynamic mini-puzzles in battles, and your iterative puzzling gauntlets in dungeons. Also almost everything is secretly part puzzle? Like, everything. They're an invasive species. They draw most of their complexity from the element system too. Each element has its own effects on certain objects and structures, and mainly you use charge shots to interact, though each attack has its own uses. Not much to say here; they're great puzzles. A couple may stump you for a while, but that's impossible to avoid, and I think CrossCode strikes a perfect challenge balance.\n\nQUESTS 5/5 WHEEEEEE\n\nWhile some quests conform to the typical hunting/gathering quests of MMOs, most boast some entirely unique content. Challenges range from unique bosses to puzzles to platforming to other familiar gimmicks that are secretly also puzzles. I won't spoil them. Quests generally use mechanics you have seen already in new, often very different, scenarios. NPCs are mostly there to be amusing or set up the gameplay, and that didn't bother me tbh.\n\nITEM MANAGEMENT 5/5 AAAAA\n\nItem and equipment acquisition? Engaging? WTF? Technically you get them like you do in any RPG. But, rare plants have high rare item drop rates, so if you know the platforming puzzle to reach em you don't have to waste much time. Enemies' drop rates rise with a high Combat Rank, which you get by killing many enemies in a row before the post-fight cooldown period ends and you get to heal to full and level up. This is tough until you're very comfortable with the area. Once you are, it's a whole new way of battling, using area knowledge to string together sequential fights. And what does the game do but give you a piece of upgradable equipment that grants the Combat Rating bonus to plants too?\n\nI actually cared about the equipment in the game too! *kisses Life Fiber Uniform* (yes they really make this reference) Equipment also matters more than level so the devs can control your power level better. Most times you can buy some basic equipment to explore, then return with items to trade to NPCs for stronger gear. Stronger gear has unique traits and you might prefer one over another, so it's nice that with trading you get to focus your resources on what you want. Sometimes you can trade some enemy drops for other ones, as I recall, which is a nice...uh, trade-off to get to make.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE 5/5 HELP\n\nCONVENIENCE REIGNS in CrossCode. Text log like in visual novels? Check. Encyclopedia of story recaps, character summaries, CrossWorlds lore & terminology, etc.? Check. Enemy index? Check. Item drop rates? Check. Available trades? You beck. This is EXTREMELY helpful for an RPG, which otherwise would require a guide or plain luck to find rare item drops. Oh yeah also there's UI? I forgot about it cuz it's really good. Also the keyboard controls for swapping elements are a bit janky but I managed.\n\nAesthetics 3/5-5/5 SUBJECTIVITY WOOOOOO\n\nYeah if ya like what you see in the trailers and screenshots, that oughta be enough. I thought the art was average-good in the beginning, but like everything else the art improves as you go. They must’ve gone back and worked on old stuff, but not too much. The music is great. No complaints there. My one objective critique is, Lea has no depth perception -- the art makes similar-height platforms look identical. I ran into so many walls and stared at so many small flat gaps I thought I couldn't cross. I'm not a fool! It's the game's fault! But actually this time!\n\nA NEW HOME DLC 6/5 WTF OMG\n\nThe paid DLC is The Culmination of CrossCode. The epilogue is complex and fascinating and rewarding. The dungeon is an incredible all-elements send-off. I adore the new quests. And the art?? The environments, the enemies, the NPC portraits are all so pretty. Don't be fooled by the letters \"DLC\": this is not Discretionary Leisure Content. If you liked the base game, this is...Deluxe...eLite...C-content??? look these are not great letters to work with ok\n\nCONCDLUDSIONO\n\nWhat else to say? CrossCode good. Buy it. Do the thing. Also, look out for Project Terra, Radical Fish's next project. It translates their current style into a 3D environment with dynamic lighting. It’s pretty & it reduces that height perspective issue. There isn’t much info about it out yet, but keep your eyes out! (figuratively pls) I'm excited for what they'll come up with.\n\nHOLY **** I MADE IT AND WITH CHARACTERS TO SPARE YESSSS — ohnowai\n- I only have 3 hours in this game but I can say it ain't worth £45. Graphics are trying to look cool but just look crap. Glitched unit textures. Runs well doesn't crash but I just hate the changes from the old total war games. Unit icons look crap I can't tell what is what. My general dies there are no notifications. Can't find how much ammo archers have. No tutorial at all. Tried attacking a tier 1 settlement only to lose everything to the towers. I'd rather play rome 2. I really hate the general idea, the fact that any old general can rock up and kill 600 men is stupid.\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- [h1]Overall Score: 8.2 / 10[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][th]Quality[/th][th]9/10[/th][th]　 　 　Very high; well maintained[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Performance[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]No lags or crashes; short loading screens[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Utility[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Rare card mechanic bugs & BGM freezes\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Controls[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Simple point and click; controller support[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Gameplay[/th][th] 7.5/10[/th][th]　　　Casual Gwent RPG meets VN[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td][td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Challenge[/i][/td][td]7/10[/td][td][i]Tricky puzzles; very low default difficulty¹[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Content[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]35h incl. dialogues; no extra game modes[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Diversity[/i][/td][td] 6/10[/td][td][i]Neat scenarios; deck building is irrelevant[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Immersion[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Meaningful decisions & great atmosphere\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr][tr][th]Design[/th][th]8/10[/th][th]　 　 　Great presentation overall[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td][/td] [td][/td][td][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Visuals[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Excellent, detailed artworks; minor flaws[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Sound[/i][/td][td]10/10[/td][td][i]HQ voice-overs and SFX; epic soundtrack\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Texts²[/i][/td][td] 8/10[/td][td][i]Decent story; deep lore; many documents[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Mapping[/i][/td][td] 4/10[/td][td][i]Plain 2D maps; no dungeons or buildings[/i][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][i]Interface[/i][/td][td] 9/10[/td][td][i]Beautiful in-game menus; overall good UI\n[/i][/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n　¹☠️　I recommend to play on [b]Bonebreaker[/b] right away! \n\n　²🌱　Branching plot with 77 side quests & 20 endings.\n\n\n\n[u]Tested with:[/u]\n\n[strike]Low[/strike], [strike]Medium[/strike], High; 1080p, 60hz\nWindows 10 Professional, 64-Bit\nIntel ® Core™ i7-7700K, 4 x 4.2 GHz\nNvidia MSI GTX 1080 (8GB GDDR5X)\n16GB DDR4 RAM; old TOSHIBA HDD\nPS4, Xbox 360 & Xbox One Controller\n\n \n[i]If you found this review helpful, feel free to check out my...[/i]\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/27010538/]⭐ Curator page[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ggwpkkthxbye]👪 Steam group[/url] | [url=https://discord.gg/VbzybDY]👾 Discord[/url]\n- This game is extremely addictive for one simple reason: it's a sandbox survival game with zero grind, because everything can be automated.\n\nIn a normal survival game, to craft 100 items, you need to first harvest 100 of some resource. In this game, you set up a power plant, a coal mine to fuel the it, an iron mine, a few assembly plants, a few conveyor belts and a chest and then wait for it to fill up with 100 grenades while you go work on another part of the factory. Meanwhile, the increasing pollution makes the bugs native to the planet increasingly agitated.\n\nAutomation is extended into every single part of the gameplay - you can mass produce buildings, then use robots to place them according to blueprints, transport items with automatic trains, and create complex control networks to let production adapt to demand. There is always something to do with very little repetition - a sudden bug attack, a bottleneck in your iron production, a depleted ore patch that forces you to explore for a new one. People spend absurd amounts of time on this game because it doesn't waste any of it.\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.\n- [h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos. This game is perfect for children who like to boast in the YouTube comments section about how they're smarter than everyone else because they get good grades in middle school and build elaborate structures in minecraft. If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
