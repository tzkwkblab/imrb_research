      "Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.",
      "Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.",
      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",

      "The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.",

      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",

      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family.

      "[b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",

      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",
      "[h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game.

Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me.

I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",
      "You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10",
      "[i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points.

      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "This game is a mood-lifter, absolutely!

      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",
      "I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",

      "For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.",
      "Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.",
      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.)

      "I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.",
      "In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",

      "[h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.",

      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
      "Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10",

      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",
      "Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it.

      "The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]",
      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking.

This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.

It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10",
      "[b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.",
      "Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle",
      "Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!",
      "When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n",
      "This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.",

      "Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in.

Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!",
      "RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.",

I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this.

      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "Nice enough game with a lot of lovely content..\nCan be stunning in places.... Real pleased I was able to buy it.\n\nVaried gameplay; tons of options...

      "[h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.",
      "So the game can be played I believe in flat screen and VR, I played in VR. You play the game in a third person prospective controlling a spirit dog. The concept is easy, get the people to the light beam, but that's easier said than done. It was very nearly a short game play video as i become really stuck to the point i nearly quit but I tried, tried and tried again until i did it. It very much reminded of a game i use to play as a kid called lemmings only in this one it doesn't matter if the people fall of the edge. Its a very challenging game, one where you can just sit and try to figure it all out. I thought it would get repetitive but each level is very different from the last.

      "[h1]After over 600 hours (played a few months extra via gamepass), im ready to drop a 'goodbye' review[/h1]\n\n\nI've bought this game knowing what im getting myself into, as i was playing FH4 for roughly 500 hours, being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality, it made me want to keep playing both Forzas for way more time than initially intended, so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason.\nWith that being being said, playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community (and i aint talking about co-op convoys, but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online). Community-wise, the game feels kinda the same like GTA V online, where you're dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you, yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them. Add to that, the horrendous platform that is called MS store / Xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own, and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform (discord is generally ideal for this), or else you're being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode. These hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the Steam version or MS version, as making a MS account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online.\n\n[b]Ok, enough chatter about friends. . . .[/b]\n\n\nThe game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike, and no matter where you are on the car spectrum IRL and in the gaming world, you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd Forza Horizon experience (i.e - you havent played FH 1-3). FH4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it, while FH5 has been given lots of QoL updates over its predecessors. Things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved, turning this game into a gmod-like experience if you're so inclined, alongside adding 'rules' to the driving experience, turning any typical race into a minigame of its own, with different objectives than just 'finish first'.\n[b]Important side note - [/b]This game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind, meaning that any gripes you have about its physics, sound, lack of competitiveness, etc, are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism. Also, this game will not fulfill your mid 2000's NFS vibes, at all. This game is its own sub-genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades (tho there are plentiful overall) and nitro, and more about car veriety and making new builds.\n\nThe game is structured with a playlist system - Each month is divided into 4 seasons (4 seasons per month - one per week). The months are called 'series' which the game devs are pushing into the game, and you have a month-long content to enjoy, with a weekly 'reset' time for each season (happening every thursday afternoon). Each month has its own theme, e.g - japanese cars, offroad racing, classic cars,  high performance track cars, etc. Each week (season) you get a new playlist of objectives to do (this is generally referred to as 'the weekly grind') like certain tournaments and other stuff. Playing with no pause would take you about 5-10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist, in a typical non tryhardy playstyle.\n\n[b]Other content in this game[/b]\n\n* Over 700 cars in total, and more are being added every month with new (free) updates.\n* A spacious open world map of Mexico where you can drive freely with other players, (randoms or friends), either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy.\n* Co-op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time.\n* Online racing, when you're playing against upto 11 other players (no bots) in typical fashion racing for xp and money (in game currency, called cr for short).\n* Community-made tracks - This is where the real fun begins especially if you're a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks. These tracks can have any theme in them like high/low performance cars, any road type, etc.\n* Auction house - You can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players.\n* Forza-official radio stations with genres like EDM, pop music, hip hop, rock, and lots of latina-based music.\n* Community livery and tunes - You can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others' from the community database.\n* Countless other minigames like capture the flag, zombies, super7 (custom objective-based challenges), and even a full scale battle royale mode.\n\n\n[b]My GamerTag is Avees128, so check out my custom tracks / tunes if you feel like it![/b]\n\n\n\n[b]Game versions and DLC expansions - Which to buy?[/b]\n\nThis game has 3 versions - Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. In general, you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version, as the deluxe only gives the (base game and) car pass, which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway, without paying for that game version. The premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and (more importantly) 2 expansion maps.\nNow, you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions (Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure) have on steam, and this is because the reviewers have compared these DLC's to the DLC's from the past FH games, which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways. Do you care about Hot Wheels at all? If no, skip it. Are you a rally fanatic? If no, then skip this one as well.\nImo, these 2 DLC's dont give an enjoyable content (and im not even a fan of HW nor Rally), especially when being compared to the past DLC's from FH4 (personally played and loved every inch of it) and FH3 (have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its DLC's - which ironically, one of them was HW).\n\n\n[b]Performance - [/b]I have a Ryzen 9 5900x + AMD RX 5700xt. When testing the built-in benchmark a year ago, i was getting the following results:\n\n1080p high - 113 FPS\n1080p ultra - 79 FPS\n1440p high - 99 FPS\n1440p ultra - 69 FPS (nice)\n\nUpscaling (FSR/DLSS) in this game is really bad, both for AMD and nVidia tech, so avoid these if you can. I cant comment on Ray Tracing since i cant run any RT features with my GPU, but from what i can tell, its minimal RT at best (which also means minimal performance drops). The game really loves Smart Access Memory / reBAR, so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20% !.\n\n\n[b]In conclusion - [/b]The game itself is great and is a legit time sink (for better and for worse), but if you're not engaged in a welcoming community, it will be a relatively short amount of time (50-100ish hours till you'll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything, so bare that in mind). If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!).",
      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",

      "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",

      "[H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]",
      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",
      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",
      "It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.",
      "The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!",

      "Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.",
      "With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.",
      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",
      "a very interesting FPS multiplayer and co-op, It would be better if it was still in development like early access because it needs some work. shorter spawn times, vehicles , larger and more varied maps, what this game has that no other FPS has is realistic weapons. you will not find another game that models modern military grade firearms more realisticily in terms of what they sound like ,recoil, look, feel ( to the extent that a pc game can offer) they are amazing and I would buy this game for 8 bucks just for that alone. But it does need work , this game could be a great title to rival Battlefield and COD franchises ( maybe not Advanced Warfare) it may not surpass those titles but it could give them a better run for the money.",
      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",

There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all.

A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.",
      "Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either",
      "Way too much grinding, no crafting, bad performance, only 4 classes, not enough replay value. Overall an unfinished game. BUT it at least it has microtransactions to get those sweet skins xD",
      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",

      "Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.",
      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "So um, I don't usually write reviews like this or much at all really. I mostly make unfunny jokes and call it a review or something super generic. I guess I'll just write whats on my mind.\n\nI really liked this game.\nI felt like I was a kid again playing Super Mario 64.\nSometimes I get tired of shooting guns. Or slashing fantasy monsters with some shiny sword. Or saving the magic land from evil. Or using hyper combos I never remember. Or collecting resources to build a quirky town. Or time managing some distant farm. Or driving some tricked out vehicles. Or investing in status points to make super strong characters. Or following a long and convoluted plot with crazy lore.\n\nSometimes I just wanna run and jump around while I pick up some cool looking stuff.\nI, uh, had a lot fun playing this game. \nThanks.",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",

      "I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",

      "Coming up to 5000 hours playing this game, and im still learning new things in multiplayer.  \n\nThe devs are by far the best ive ever seen.  FFF (Friday Fun Facts) is a blog post they write up every Friday.  Every. Single. Friday. For the last ... 4 years?  look at them on their website, its not a 2 min blurb, its a full review of what they've done that week, and where they're headed, what their plans are, current iterations they're going over, complete with pictures and sometimes *chuckle* hand drawn graphs.  \n\nTheir IRC channel (there is a link on their website) has someone on the dev team there pretty much 24/7.  Not just \"community manager\" nitwits (Trangar, te he), but guys like Rseding91 (their C++ guru) that are programming the actual updates.  \n\nOh.  There are updates.\n\nAre there sometimes bugs in the patches?  Sure.  Which is why you sometimes see 2 patches in the same day.  Bugs get quashed immediately whenever possible.  \n\nWhile this review doesnt speak much about the game, the team behind it deserves the recognition - its amazing, thoughtul, and incredibly well done because of them.\n\nIn a nutshell, its similar to RTS games like starcraft, where you build up and gather resources.  But instead of spending 20 minutes to build up a base to have the game end in 2, you keep building.\n\nBuilding Bigger.\n\nMaking things more efficient.\n\nTearing down and rebuidling.\n\nIm almost 5000 hours in and sticking with vanilla until I can personally say Ive mastered it.

      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",

      "Small impressions after 15 hours of gameplay\n\n+ realistic, and slow (as I have long wished in a swat/rainbow six successor)\n+ complex maps that are always being expanded and new ones are added.\n+ very intelligent AI even if it has times aimbot.\n(hides in closets, fake surrender, throws away gun takes it again when not paying attention or pulls knife)\n+ always feedback from the devs current work on the game (as I know it in no other game like)\n+ sound backdrop \n+ very nice atmosphere\n+ friendly community\n\n= game is from price performance really good, \nso don't be fooled by the supporter edition it is only there to support the developers.\n\n- the footsteps sounds you can partly not distinguish whether they are under you or above you.\n- in current status still too few weapons\n- singleplayer is no fun because the ally ai is too strong and everything aimbottet away\n\nFrom me the game is absolutely recommended, especially with friends it is fun. My best shooter of this year. \nWish the developers much success, and that they achieve what they imagine.",
      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",
      "Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.",
      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.",
      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",
      "This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",
      "Go ahead and try to find something to criticize about this game. \n\nMaybe graphics scalability? Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or \"cheap\" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you've never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.",
      "If you want to play D&D but don't have friends, just get this game.",
      "I wish there were a \"mixed\" option for recommending this game, as I think for a lot of people out there, this is a fantastic game, and it's definitely well made with a lot of love and attention to detail in many respects. I really like puzzles and problem solving, so part of my disappointment with The Witness is that I really thought I would enjoy the game. Myst was one of my favorite games growing up, and I was extremely excited to see a well-reviewed game in the Myst genre surface after far too long. \n\nThe problem for me was that The Witness is very much a game about the journey, and not the destination. It turns its head on the genre as it's less a game about solving puzzles within a set of rules, and more about discovering what those rules are. And for the most part, it does that well. Instead of the usual game conventions, rewards for solving hard puzzles weren't any kind of story unlock, more just to give you a harder puzzle. That approach was fun for awhile, but some story unlock would've been appreciated, especially because there is so much mystery and it's such an immersive world that was clearly built for a reason and has a fascinating backstory. \n\nSome of the mechanics also just seem arbitrary, or at the very least, not quite obvious enough. Sometimes perspective puzzles require you to either take a screenshot or jot down on pencil and paper the answer, then transfer it on screen. That seems like lazy game design and worst of all, takes you out of the immersive experience. It's possible I'm mostly tone deaf, as some of the sound puzzles seemed almost impossible to me, despite numerous listens. There's also just the repetitiveness of the \"pathfinding\" puzzles, which range from challenging (and satisfying) to punitive in their difficulty spikes. It's in these difficulty spikes where I think the core game mechanic of pathfinding lets you down, as it requires you to be much more of a planner than a \"hands on\" problem solver. In a game like this, I would think it would accommodate multiple approaches, but really there's a right way to approach this game, and a wrong way. Unfortunately for me, I think the way I approach puzzles (trial and error) is strongly discouraged, at times in punitive ways. \n\nThe philosophy from the audio/video portions will likely be appreciated by some, and for some come off as the worst kind of douchey-hipster nonsense. Had they been delivered in shorter pieces, I might've fallen into the former. But as rambling as some of them are, I found them more annoying than enjoyable unfortunately. \n\nI don't know, I'm really torn on this. It's a well made game, and while it seems so open and non-confined, I found the game to be far too linear in mechanics and how to approach problem solving. At times it actually made me feel like a lesser thinker because I have a different approach to puzzles than what the game designer prefers. What I'm sure is a really fun journey for some, left me disappointed with the destination. \n\nAm realizing this reads a lot like an apology for not liking this game, which I think it is. I really, really wanted to love The Witness, but in the end, not only was this game not for me, but I genuinely feel lesser for that fact because I feel like I should have loved it, and just didn't.",
      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",
      "Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",
      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.",
      "Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.",

      "9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",

      "This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.",
      "As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.",
      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".",
      "It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.",
      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",
      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.",
      "Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"",
      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)",

I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in.

      "The arguably ugly graphics initially turned me off, as I'm sure it will for many of you, but in the end, they turned out to be unique, making an excellent game more memorable. I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.",

You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly.

      "I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.",
      "If you want to cut your teeth on the Final Boss of box-pushing puzzle games, then have I got the game for you.\n\nRight out of the gate SSR offers a somewhat uneven mix of real head-scratchers and what I can only describe as pity puzzles, but quickly reveals itself to be the sort of puzzler that mandates particularly extensive sessions of staring at the seemingly inconsequential number of tiles onscreen and poking experimentally at them until something starts to click. This demands a little more patience than I ordinarily have, but I was starting to appreciate the design as I acclimatized to it.\n\nThen I arrived at The Great Tower level (in only the second subsection of the overworld), which all at once foists about 4 times more pieces on you than you've dealt with previously, while simultaneously introducing a Z-axis and the concept of using pieces as platforms mid-puzzle.\n\nSSR does have a well-executed and forgiving Undo function with basically unlimited storage which is a great thing to have up until the time spent rewinding would outweigh the time spent to simply restart the puzzle and do over; the only way it could be made practical on a level that large would be if you had a full-on timeline scrubber like in the rerelease of Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThere's patience, there's logic, and then there's [b]this.[/b] I play puzzle games to try and [i]relieve[/i] stress, not the other way round.

The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.",

      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",

It feels like a special privilege to play through it. Its a piece of art for the twenty first century. It's a reminder that there still exists impossible beauty in what sometimes feels like a bleak hopeless materialistic world. If you remain steadfast though and look for it, you will find things that will inspire you, things that will give you hope again and things that will remind you of why life is so beautiful and worth fighting for. Don't despair, fight. Fight for Ori and everything she stands for. It's worth it.",

      "The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.",
      "After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.",

      "Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle."

      "In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.

      "[h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means.

      "The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n",
      "[h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]",
      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",

      "Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game.

All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed.

      "TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",

      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",

      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",
      "This game should have easily swept the game awards for art and theme.  \nthe mechanics, music, visuals, and story blend together flawlessly to communicate the experience of bitter ruin and abrupt descent into calamity.  The gameplay loop is pretty standard for a party based RPG.  Prepare, Enter the dungeon, kill the monster, loot, gain power, then do it again in a tougher dungeon.  The sanity system, very good writing and voice acting personalize the experience and keep you locked in your gaming chair anxious to delve deeper into just how bad things really are.",
      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",
      "The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.",
      "This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day.

      "Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either",

      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",

      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails.

I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history.

      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",

      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",

      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended",
      "As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.",

      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",
      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.",
      "This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.",
      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",
      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",

      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",
      "In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n",
      "I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.",
      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",
      "\"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing.

      "Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.",
      "To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.",

      "If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!",
      "Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.",
      "A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.",

      "A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
      "I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.",
      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety.

Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.",
      "In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]",
      "I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:\n\n1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on  \n2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure\n3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects\n4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues\n5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view\n6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet\n7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution\n8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time",
      "Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.",

      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",

      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "[i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure.

This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE.

It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud",
      "$15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.",

      "[h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]",
      "if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game.

      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",

      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "The Gameplay when jack enters the fray, its ridicosly hard. To the point its boring trying over and over agaiin. Stay clear of this mess. This is no horror game, and not even a shooter.\n\n(update), after a 14 hour playthrough i can only speak for myself but it was one of the worst games i ever bought, its graphics are ok but gamewise its horrendous.  Very little playarea and a linear story thats so hopelessly bankrupt of ideas. \n\nFor me RDR2 (red dead redemption 2) is a 9 outof 10. Resident evil 7 is at best a 2 out of 10.\nI've got almost 40 games in my library and this one is probably gamewise at nr 39 of those 40\n Dont buy this crap",
      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",
      "The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before.

      "I had the privilege of playing a game that provided an immersive and emotional experience set during the Great Patriotic War. This game, which I highly recommend. From the moment you start playing, it's evident that the developers spared no effort in recreating the atmosphere of the era. \nOne aspect that truly impressed me was the game's narrative. The storylines, filled with genuine human drama.\nI also must commend the game's sound design.",
      "Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.",

      "RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n",

      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",
      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",
      "I had avoided this due to the bad reviews down to its apparent abandonment on the PC platform by the developers. However, upon discovering that this had been rectified and due to the huge Christmas sale I bought it. So glad I did as, in my opinion this is the best MK game I have ever played. \n\nIts absurdly beautiful with superb animations.\nThe arenas looks fantastic and the characters feel and react as if they are really within the scene rather than floating around on top, this is added to by some great arena interactions.\n\nThere is loads of content and characters, although I would love to see the NPC characters such as Rain included. \n\nThe story is actually really interesting certainly the most gripping I have encountered in this genre.\n\nBut the fluidity, God! the fluidity of the fighting! its soooo good. To me MK games to be have always felt a little on the stiff side but not this one. \n\nDo yourself a favour and buy it, even if your too scared to go online and be shamed over and over.\nJust play the Story Mode or Towers and  then shame your mates when they come over.\n\nYou will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",
      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",
      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",
      "A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n",

And yes, it's got lots of micro transactions. I bought 35,000 VC for my career, but i didnt feel forced. Don't wanna buy? THEN DON'T! It's playable whether you buy or not.

[/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",
      "So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.",
      "[h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]",
      "The good news: you came out of cryogenic suspension in good health.\n\nThe bad news: you're critically low on supplies.\n\nThe good news: there are plenty of other vessels within range.\n\nThe bad news: they're all derelict.\n\nThe good news: you have a fleet of salvage drones you can send into the derelicts to gather supplies.\n\nThe bad news: your drones aren't the only things moving around those derelicts. And the other moving things are hostile. And the half-broken infrastructure on those derelicts is prone to fail explosively. And parts of your drones and your ship break too. And your only interaction with the outside world is with the drones. And your only interaction with the drones is through a clunky command-line interface.

I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.",
      "this 3D robot-shooting theme was attracting me,  so i bought it, but after i played it, i found the game is terrible.\n\nshooting is unreal, character's animations(moving, jumping, that kind of things) are weird, enemy AI is stupid. and can i  skip all the voice and cutscene?Some can skip, some can't, i don't want to see or listen them all when i play it again. \n\nAlso this game has some bugs, in level 1, there are two lasers side-by-side, in original, they are moving opposite, but when i reload the chackpoint, they become moving together, so no matter what i do, i always take some damage. Oh, and don't look at my achievement, bug did it.\n\nAnd when i was progressing the level 2, i can see the \"level select\" has it, but the next day i wanted to continue, i selected the \"Campaign 1\" thoughtless, then i returned to menu, the level 2 in \"level select\" was gone, so i had to play level 1 again, \"THAT\" is bad, dude.\n\nAlthrough this is a indie game, but i think you can do better than this. there are some examples i think you can learn something from them: ME series, Magrunner: Dark Pulse, Alien rage, they all use UE3 Engine.\n\nAll in all, this game is \"not bad\", not great, not good, just \"not bad\", I hope the next game you can do better.\n\nBtw, this is my first review, sorry for my bad English and non-professional comment:P",

I had really high hopes from the devs of mirror but this was a big letdown as this game has nothing going for it unlike the quality nsfw elements that the first game had as its strong point.\n\nIf you are a weeb and you like the move the slot type games its ok but otherwise no need to play.",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",
      "For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",

It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud",

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",

The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.",

      "I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.",
      "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.",
      "Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.",
      "I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.",

      "I technically got this game for free, as it was bought for me from a friend. And honestly, I didn't really like it. She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse. A bit anxiety inducing for me, just given the circumstances, talking about life and death. Just not my personal cup of tea.",
      "To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n",
      "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",
      "Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...",

That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",
      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",
      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10",

      "We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics.

      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",

      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",

      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",

I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!",
      "Not For Broadcast is a good game... but it has some issues.\n\nThe story is really captivating; though the game does switch between humour and a serious story quite often, both are excellently done. Advance (the political party who ends up getting into power and becomes authoritarian) actually only gets into power in the first part of the game (the tutorial broadcast). You actually get to see the descent into authoritarianism and dystopia, which basically no other game (at least, any game I've ever played) has actually done, and not really any other forms of media either. You also get to influence some events in game [spoiler](for example, one of the ads you can play is an advertisement for a children's toy, and later there is an... incident... involving the toy, and (if you played the ad), the presenters of National Nightly News (Jeremy and Megan) state in a segment regarding the incident that they should never have advertised the toy.[/spoiler] It's a really minor thing, because you can just choose [i]not[/i] to play the ad, but I really love that detail), and having a noticeable impact on anything is really enjoyable.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly good. You basically just have to be on your toes, switching to different cameras every now and again, being ready to censor things, and being ready to go to the adverts. All basic tasks, but since you're doing most of them together, it relies on you being attentive and reactive. The only part of the gameplay I would criticize is the signal interference section. It's easy, and doesn't even really distract you, as you just have to move a slider up and down with a slight bit of delay. It's just not a fun part of the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be the lag; something which I know I'm not alone in experiencing. Online, it suggests closing down performance heavy tasks, such as web browsers, but I know for a fact that I had a few webpages up when I was playing the free prologue (the first broadcast, which gives a pretty good idea of what the game is), and experienced no issues at all. I really don't know what the coding differences between the paid version and the prologue of the game are, but that doesn't seem like it should be a difference. Generally the lag was irritating, but not something that hinders you in any way, but there is one level where you're advised to switch screens because naked protesters may pop up to protest Advance's policies. Visual lag, in this case, really isn't good. I also just got a windows pop up saying that the game was frozen, and so I had to close it down... not great.\n\nOverall; the gameplay is good, with really the exception of the interference task, and the story is excellent, but the technical issues are just... really, really irritating. I would recommend the game, but I would warn you that the technical issues do end up being quite irritating.\n\nOverall; the game is good, but the technical issues can be annoying.",
      "A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.",
      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",

      "TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!",
      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options.

Do not support these thieves\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- if you're looking to experience the greatest time travel drama ever made then I really recommend giving it a chance because there is a lot to love here. Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate. If you've only watched the anime, this is worth checking out for the additional endings and science themes.\n\nSteins;Gate Elite is a new way to discover the classic story, fusing the anime with the visual novel. El Psy Kongroo, 10/10\n- This game is boring, and the workshop is too little too late. In short, you should purchase Valheim. Its the best money Ive ever spent on Steam, and would have gladly paid three times the price. Perhaps in the future, other game Devs will make games like Valheim , and stop releasing garbage like this, or Red Dead, or CyberPunk, or Assassians Crud, Ect.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- [i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points. Points unlock ‘upgrades’ for your plague. The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h3] Story: [/h3]\nThis game revolves around a neighbor that is sleeping with the mom and the daughter (Separately) and trying not to get caught. Someone is the neighborhood knows the whole story, but who \ncould that be? \n\n[h3] Overall Score: [/h3]\n\nScore: 3.8 - Length, Character Development, and Storytelling leaves a lot to be desired with this game. This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- This game is a mood-lifter, absolutely! Sweet colors, catchy music, wonderful narrator saying very kind words, the sound effects are poppy and fun, it's rewarding to watch the donuts drift across the puzzle. This is the kind of game you play to vibe and unwind after a hard day, refreshing and sweet. <3\n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- The EA anticheat successfully prevents players who aren't cheating from entering the game.\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- turns out you do alot more then just tax evasion\n\n... I murdered a snail for rent money\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- This is Wario Land but fast. All the fortnite zoomers are gonna play this and talk about it like Fight Night Fungus ft. Frederick Leopold Fazbearington while nobody's gonna play the Wario Land games :(((( \n\nTLDR: Fire. Goku fortnite. My nuts hang :(\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- UPDATE - EVERY positive review has little hours played, also the hours after review are none. Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- Driving feels unrealistic, am I driving a car, or a boat?\nStealth system simply sucks, can't hide bodies, each guard in the restricted area knows exaclty where are you hiding after one of them spots you.\nMade a refund request.\n\nAlthought graphic is nice, and story seems fun.\nI'd recommend to pick this on sale, and not for a full price.\n- Okami is the best non-Zelda Zelda game, but also best dog simulator.\n\n10/10 Dog features include:\n\nYou can bark at people for no reason! You can dig up bones! You can catch a birb in your mouth and then prance! You can bite people in the crotch and they are like \"hey! what! why i oughta!\" If you see a demon, you can pee on it!\n\n\nPlease purchase The Legend of Dog Zelda for a good time.\n- Who would win?\n\nThe highest-grossing media franchise of all time OR 2 British bois\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- [b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This game got criminally low attention.\nThis is basically Risk Of Rain, but Top Down, less budget and same amount of fun.\nI've played just a bit before writing this, and yes, I can already see some flaws in the game, yet it definitely is worth of your attention. Especially with the sale price.\nWill update the review after investing more hours into it\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- Y'all couldn't let her have a happy ending, but you could have at least let the poor little baby keep Comrade Mitten. Reality is, war has no good side, no true enemy, just innocents who die and suffer. Maybe Aysa's future is brighter there, after everything. :(\n\nWhat a sad journey with a sad conclusion, but it was a great little story nonetheless.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Nice enough game with a lot of lovely content..\nCan be stunning in places.... Real pleased I was able to buy it.\n\nVaried gameplay; tons of options... Bots to Live MultiPalyer Ops at the flick of a switch.\n\nRuns great on my 3-year old rig with a newish GPU (GTX1070).\nHas a few things a few percent of people with strange expectations are ungrateful about..\n\n1) The Game is designed to look even better on future hardware (such as the very recently released GTX1080Ti).\n2) A GOOD rig is required to run this game. A top i5 or an i7 is going to be the way to go. No potatoes.\n3) It did run nicely on Medium settings on my 3y/o Haswell i5 R9 280 Crossfire rig... No complaints there.\n4) You NEED a Good Internet connection. We have Fiber-Optic and have no connection issues in the Far East.\n5) A GTX1070 Will run it nicely on Pretty High settings; assuming you have a good Motherboard & upated Drivers.\n6) Make sure you install the game on a good Gaming-Hard-Drive/SSD, and not on some rusty old File Drive.\n7) Enjoy.... \n    ...it might take a while to get your head around all the details of the game and what to do, but that`s good. \n \nOh, and yes there are a couple of bugs.. \nThose of us who re-map cannot steer the motorcycles.\nThere is no Mapping for the 6-Home/End Keys.... for some unknown reason.\nThere may be others I have not found yet.\n- [h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!\n- This innocent-looking golf game really is not a golf game. Except it is a golf game. Except it isn't. Essentially, WTG? uses \"golf game\" as its medium, through which it tells a staggering number of jokes and punchlines. Expect the unexpected. But always expect there to be puns.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- [h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\n\n【グループB】\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...\n- [h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!\n- This game should have easily swept the game awards for art and theme.  \nthe mechanics, music, visuals, and story blend together flawlessly to communicate the experience of bitter ruin and abrupt descent into calamity.  The gameplay loop is pretty standard for a party based RPG.  Prepare, Enter the dungeon, kill the monster, loot, gain power, then do it again in a tougher dungeon.  The sanity system, very good writing and voice acting personalize the experience and keep you locked in your gaming chair anxious to delve deeper into just how bad things really are.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either\n- ~ DIFFICULTY ~\n\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n🔲 Easy\n🔲 Normal\n✅ Hard\n🔲 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n🔲 MS Paint\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Meh\n🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game\n✅ Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n🔲 Masterpiece\n\n~ MUSIC ~\n\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Not special\n🔲 Good\n✅ Beautiful\n\nI WILL GIVE YOU MY ALL! and also FLAMES OF LOVE is a hit\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n🔲 This game has no story\n🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n✅ It's there for the people who want it\n🔲 Well written\n🔲 Epic story\n🔲 Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n🔲 Free\n🔲 Underpriced\n✅ Perfect Price\n🔲 Could be cheaper\n🔲 Overpriced\n🔲 Complete waste of money\n\nIt went free on some point\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\n✅ Average\n🔲 High end\n🔲 NASA computer\n\n~ LENGTH ~\n\n🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)\n🔲Short (2 - 15 hours)\n🔲 Average (15-50 hours)\n🔲 Long (50-90 hours)\n🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)\n✅ No ending\n\n~ FUN ~\n\n🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\n🔲 Repetitive\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\n🔲The kind of fun you'll remember\n✅ Ride of your life\n\n~ REPLAYABILITY~\n\n🔲 It's a one-time experience\n🔲 Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months/years\n✅ Definitely\n🔲 Infinitely replayable\n\n~ WORTH BUYING ~\n\n🔲 No\n✅ Wait for sale\n✅ Yes\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- Why do people think they are funny and rating something in the opposite direction to what is obviously their true opinion?  There should be a rule against that.  Oh ya, and the \"game\" is cringe-worthy.  Get it for $0.01 and mine it for $0.04 worth of cards.\n- I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:\n\n1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on  \n2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure\n3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects\n4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues\n5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view\n6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet\n7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution\n8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- Good old point and click style\nLots of interactions\nDope beats\nSweet artstyle and graphics\nIronic humour with self-loathing jokes\nWeird characters with voice acting\nMany dialogue options\n\nThis is your game for a wacky and hilarious adventure.\n\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game. It is hands down THE best non-fire emblem game that falls under the latter category of styles and punches so far above its weight class that at one point while playing i idly wondered if they poached an intelligent systems game designer or something (they didnt).\n- \"Do not ask, 'Is Pizza Tower worth my time?' Instead ask, 'Am I worth Pizza Tower's time?'\"\nSun Tzu- Art of War\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n\n- I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.\n- [b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- horrible very very very very bad bad grafics fps and game play \nbut if you can play the game better do it i can watch jacksepticeye play it\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- + The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane\n+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.)\n+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean\n+ Too many achievements to count for\n+ Too many hours spent in perspective\n+ Best poop simulator EVER!\n\n- Incompatible with social life outside the PC.\n- UPDATE: Had the music on the \"+\" but moved it here. Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating. Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack.\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!\n- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community\n- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding\n- Skins.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o\n- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!\n- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- [h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:\n\n1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on  \n2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure\n3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects\n4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues\n5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view\n6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet\n7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution\n8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- ---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☑ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☑ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☑ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☑ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☑ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☑ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☑ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10\n\n\n\n\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)???

Do not support these thieves\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- Great Game, play the Demo instead of reading reviews.\n- Buy if you want an average sandbox game. Don't buy for the mediocre story, boss battles or repetitive missions.\n\n\nMGO: I want to like it, but it has so many problems.\n\n-until recently had no push-to-talk\n-peer-to-peer connections meaning lag depending on the host, and being sent back to lobby if the host leaves. CQC also will lag where you will grapple back and forth.\n-no text chat\netc.\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- if you're looking to experience the greatest time travel drama ever made then I really recommend giving it a chance because there is a lot to love here. Steins;Gate: Elite is a great game, every part is animated, which is nice. Many scenes have completely different music and honestly it all fits better. I think it is the best version of Steins;Gate. If you've only watched the anime, this is worth checking out for the additional endings and science themes.\n\nSteins;Gate Elite is a new way to discover the classic story, fusing the anime with the visual novel. El Psy Kongroo, 10/10\n- This game is boring, and the workshop is too little too late. In short, you should purchase Valheim. Its the best money Ive ever spent on Steam, and would have gladly paid three times the price. Perhaps in the future, other game Devs will make games like Valheim , and stop releasing garbage like this, or Red Dead, or CyberPunk, or Assassians Crud, Ect.\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.\n- I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- Events that took place:\n\nDid not want to sell player,\nGot an offer for said player,\nRejected the offer,\nPlayer demaned to be allowed to speak to the club,\nGot a second offer from said club,\nEssentially forced to accept the offer,\nPlayer reached an agreement with the club,\nWished player the \"best of luck\" in his future endeavours,\nPlayer is angry that he is leaving,\nPlayer considerers his new club a \"step down\" in his career,\nReminder: Player demanded to go to said club,\nMe finding solice in the fact that FM19 although lacking in the football department, delivers a brilliant experience in dealings with manic and psychotic people.\n\nAllow me to grant you an insight into SI's employee knowledge on the subject their games are about. I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.\n- You probably have to be a dedicated wargamer to remember Fields of Glory, a turn-based strategy series that covered almost every era of ancient warfare. The historical scope was deep and wide, but the rules and features were shallow and anorexic... just saying. The game needed an overhaul. The graphics needed a facelift, and the gameplay and ruleset needed growth hormones. This game addresses those issues definitively.\n\nIt was a matter of bringing the game over to the Battle Academy engine, Which in my opinion is one of the most robust tbs platforms out there. It handles WW2 games, fantasy games like Hell, Sci-Fi with Sanctus Reach, and historical wargames Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai. I'm assuming that, like the old FoG, this game will eventually have a slew of historical skins DLC. Everything will be overpriced and never go on sale, but if you're a fan of any of the games above like me, you'll bite the hook... like me.\n\nThe mechanics and rules of the game work almost the exact same way as Pike and Shot and Sengoku Jidai, not the old FoG. It's lazy but it works. If you've played either, you won't need the tutorial. You'd also recognize the soft pastel, almost cartoony maps. The game looks much better than previous games. The rigid, boxey blob models are gone, replaced by units that shuffle nervously, taunt their foes, and continue swinging at each other in between turns. It's a Slitherine tbs that actually feels alive and breathing.    \n\nIt's a straight up, left-click only tbs. You'll have a command unit with a command range, units outside of which will suffer a penalty. Units have zones of control. Once engaged in melee, units won't disengage, but will continue fighting each turn until one breaks. Victorious units may compulsively pursue routed foes, even disappearing off the map, never to be seen again...Units gain advantages and suffer penalties based on terrain and morale. Units get buffs for adjacent allies, and penalties if those allies are routed. There are bonuses for flanking, charging, and fighting on the high ground. There is no experience gain, no upgrades or leveling, and no rpg elements.\n\nAll the elements you'd expect from a good tbs are here, implemented in an approachable, almost casual way that you can enjoy without having to put down your drink or jazz cigarette. Turn based tacticians should approve. 8/10\n- [i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points.

The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- [h2] Visual Novel Reviews [/h2]\n\n[b] TLDR [/b] Two scenes, no customization, no choices, character development needs work, but the Extremely short story delivered (If you know what I mean) a whopping 38 minutes of game play for me. \n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Question[/th]\n        [th]Answer[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Buy Again[/td]\n        [td]No, I wouldn't.

This is the second game that this developer has released, so I am not disappointed that I spent 5$ dollars on a game that they created, but I will say that I will think Long and Hard (No Pun Intended) before purchasing another game from this studio.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- This game is a mood-lifter, absolutely! Sweet colors, catchy music, wonderful narrator saying very kind words, the sound effects are poppy and fun, it's rewarding to watch the donuts drift across the puzzle. This is the kind of game you play to vibe and unwind after a hard day, refreshing and sweet. <3\n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- This game is great and is worth the cost, I have not tried it in VR yet but I imagine it's great....I have a slight urge to join the US military all of a sudden...\n- For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.\n- Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- I bought this game because it was supposed to be like Harvest Moon. I'm now close to finishing an ingame year.\n\n+ The town and art style is very much like Harvest Moon\n+ There are a lot of interesting characters with lovely art to socialize with\n+ The dog is helpful, barking on spots where you could dig out some items\n+ Some events, scenes and dialogues in this game made me smile to no end. This is a happy game.\n\n- You have a farmland of 40 tiles and farm by seeding tile by tile and watering tile by tile. The watering can is your only tool and upgradable to water 3x3 tiles.\n- Friendship is a grind, as is tradition in the genre. I once gifted a whole harvest to a girl without visable change in the 1 to 10 affection meter. After finishing the friendship grind on 3 villagers, the game seemed to reward me with... some random dialogue lines.\n- You can only bind the shovel and watering can. You cannot bind anything else like the brush or milking device or animal fodder. This makes the daily barn work quite nasty.\n\n\nIf you need a Harvest Moon on PC, this isn't what you want. Games like \"Friends of Mineral Town\" had a significantly larger focus on farming simulation. World's Dawn is a small town simulator with a little gardening on the side.\n- In less skilled hands, throwing about terms like 'nostalgic' and 'cosy' could easily be turned into negatives when describing 'VIDEOVERSE'. However, Lucy Blundell, the sole developer behind Kinmoku and 'VIDEOVERSE' has improved upon every aspect of her first title, the still very enjoyable 'One Night Stand'. The two games have little in common, but it is clear from the outset that it is a passion project of the developer, with many aspects of herself cleverly interwoven into the characters and the setting. Playing as Emmett in the early days of online forums in a world very close to the real one, the user can choose to make the community a more pleasant and safer space for fellow Shark owners, or do the precise opposite and add to the trolling and profanity that coarsened even forums 20 years ago and is certainly far more prevalent in today's (deliberately) polarised social media.\n\nThe soundtrack complements the environment and narrative design, with some neat musical segues at particularly dramatic moments between the main characters. The art is very expressive where it makes sense for it to be, and purposefully Miiverse adjacent and equally expressive with the avatars. The characters themselves are plausible and interestingly flawed as teenagers are when discovering their own selves and the world around them. There are multiple endings to discover that hinge on choices made throughout each chapter, including how close Emmett is to his friends.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who believes in seriously supporting indie game development, wants a fresh take on visual novels, and/or is of a certain age like the developer and myself who remembers what the internet was like at the turn of the century.\n\nFor total transparency, I did do some beta testing on the game as a fellow narrative designer working in the industry, but all of these thoughts are my own. I also paid for a full release copy on the day it came out (today!) and I sincerely believe it's more than worth your time and money.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- [h1] 9/10 [/h1]\n[h1] As a sequel to Steins;Gate, you won't be able to understand the content of the game without playing the previous game. [/h1]\n\nThe sequel to the famous visual novel game Steins;Gate. Although some people think that Steins;Gate 0 is not as good as its predecessor, I think this game is a well-deserved excellent sequel.\n\nA change from the witty and relaxed game style of the previous game, the overall atmosphere of this game is heavy, and personally I prefer this kind of visual novel work. The plot of the game is naturally wonderful, so I won’t comment here to avoid spoilers. If you are deeply attracted by the game’s background settings and characters before playing Steins;Gate, then this work must be worthwhile. The music of this game is also very beautiful, and it will never disappoint the players. The only shortcoming of it is that the description of some characters is too sloppy and the characterization is insufficient, such as Kagari.\n\nIn any case, this one is definitely a must-try work for players who love Steins;Gate, and it is an important addition to the series of plots. As a related supplementary sequel, its nature is also destined that players must play the previous game in order to understand the content of this one.\n- The EA anticheat successfully prevents players who aren't cheating from entering the game.\n- Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.\n- turns out you do alot more then just tax evasion\n\n... I murdered a snail for rent money\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- This is Wario Land but fast. All the fortnite zoomers are gonna play this and talk about it like Fight Night Fungus ft. Frederick Leopold Fazbearington while nobody's gonna play the Wario Land games :(((( \n\nTLDR: Fire. Goku fortnite. My nuts hang :(\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it. It is worth the price for the amount of fun time you can have with it.\n\nPositives:\n+ Initially the game gives you some good frights and tension\n+ Variety of characters, ethnics and aesthetics to pick and chose from\n+ Variety of skills and abilities that are mostly unique and some have good synergy\n+ Variety of maps\n+ DLC costs are fair\n+ Skin costs are fair\n+ One of very few companies who communicates with the community\n+ A lot of good license characters available\n+ The game has a tutorial that explains the basics\n+ Various ways to play the game (stealth / agressive)\n\nNegatives:\n- A few bugs here and there\n- Some really annoying perks / addons on killers / survivors like 1 shot long range axes (to name an example), keys and moris (to name a few more)\n- Toxic community - Not everyone is toxic but a large portion of players are but lets be real you get that in every game these days\n- Matchmaking is pretty bad (but DBD is trying to fix this)\n- Sometimes unfair hit detection - Some hits look like you are being smacked way out of range or as a killer you see the grab animation on a survivor and then it just cancels out\n- Steep learning curve / unforgiving gameplay. You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.\n- Trash.\nAbsolutely destroyed the game to modify it to give it away for free on epic, to make a shit Chinese company happy.\nStabbing regular and veteran players in the back, that have been playing on steam since the beginning. The stellar update will;\n\n-Reset your side job progression,\n-Reset your skill tree\n-Remove all mod compatibility\n-Remove Linux support.\n\nAll of this for no reason except greed. You have lost my support and confidence.\nWell done Overkill, enjoy your crossplay.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one.

Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- UPDATE - EVERY positive review has little hours played, also the hours after review are none. Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- Driving feels unrealistic, am I driving a car, or a boat?\nStealth system simply sucks, can't hide bodies, each guard in the restricted area knows exaclty where are you hiding after one of them spots you.\nMade a refund request.\n\nAlthought graphic is nice, and story seems fun.\nI'd recommend to pick this on sale, and not for a full price.\n- Okami is the best non-Zelda Zelda game, but also best dog simulator.\n\n10/10 Dog features include:\n\nYou can bark at people for no reason! You can dig up bones! You can catch a birb in your mouth and then prance! You can bite people in the crotch and they are like \"hey! what! why i oughta!\" If you see a demon, you can pee on it!\n\n\nPlease purchase The Legend of Dog Zelda for a good time.\n- Who would win?\n\nThe highest-grossing media franchise of all time OR 2 British bois\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- [b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting. \nI was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game. \n\nI normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore. \n\nYou are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly. \n\nStory/writing: 10\nMusic: 8\nReplay value: 7\nGameplay: 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything. \n\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- The fact that this VN used to be the highest rated game that hasn't been released outside Japan until, well, it was released outside Japan says it all. A must-buy position for every VN enthusiast and an insteresting position for any other player. Criminally underplayed (~55% of purchased copies haven't been started yet), true hidden gem. Consider buying it when on sale.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This game got criminally low attention.\nThis is basically Risk Of Rain, but Top Down, less budget and same amount of fun.\nI've played just a bit before writing this, and yes, I can already see some flaws in the game, yet it definitely is worth of your attention. Especially with the sale price.\nWill update the review after investing more hours into it\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- Y'all couldn't let her have a happy ending, but you could have at least let the poor little baby keep Comrade Mitten. Reality is, war has no good side, no true enemy, just innocents who die and suffer. Maybe Aysa's future is brighter there, after everything. :(\n\nWhat a sad journey with a sad conclusion, but it was a great little story nonetheless.\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Nice enough game with a lot of lovely content..\nCan be stunning in places.... Real pleased I was able to buy it.\n\nVaried gameplay; tons of options... Bots to Live MultiPalyer Ops at the flick of a switch.\n\nRuns great on my 3-year old rig with a newish GPU (GTX1070).\nHas a few things a few percent of people with strange expectations are ungrateful about..\n\n1) The Game is designed to look even better on future hardware (such as the very recently released GTX1080Ti).\n2) A GOOD rig is required to run this game. A top i5 or an i7 is going to be the way to go. No potatoes.\n3) It did run nicely on Medium settings on my 3y/o Haswell i5 R9 280 Crossfire rig... No complaints there.\n4) You NEED a Good Internet connection. We have Fiber-Optic and have no connection issues in the Far East.\n5) A GTX1070 Will run it nicely on Pretty High settings; assuming you have a good Motherboard & upated Drivers.\n6) Make sure you install the game on a good Gaming-Hard-Drive/SSD, and not on some rusty old File Drive.\n7) Enjoy.... \n    ...it might take a while to get your head around all the details of the game and what to do, but that`s good. \n \nOh, and yes there are a couple of bugs.. \nThose of us who re-map cannot steer the motorcycles.\nThere is no Mapping for the 6-Home/End Keys.... for some unknown reason.\nThere may be others I have not found yet.\n- [h1]Press F11 for Fullscreen and know that your inventory has two parts[/h1]\n\n\nThe Steam version seems like an improved version of the mobile version. I got stuck and looked at screenshots and guides and none of them were helpful (I've never played the mobile version just in case you were wondering. A guide I saw mentioned only 5 endings but this version features more than that)\n\nI got over my block when I realized that there were another set of items in my inventory (I didn't notice that it said 1/2 at first)\n\nI haven't finished the game yet though, so I might update my review, but so far, everything looks good!\n- This innocent-looking golf game really is not a golf game. Except it is a golf game. Except it isn't. Essentially, WTG? uses \"golf game\" as its medium, through which it tells a staggering number of jokes and punchlines. Expect the unexpected. But always expect there to be puns.\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- [h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.\n\n【グループB】\n- This game made me so miserable . \nThe writing can be as funny as heartbreaking \nThe Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard \nA lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )\n\nPro : The whole game \nCon : Absolutely nothing \n\nIt's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n\n- [h1]I enjoyed the game. Negative reviews can be more helpful though. One negative review can't hurt.[/h1]\n\nI'll keep the pros short:\n - Stress reliever\n - You can kill people in interesting ways\n - Mods can enhance this experience further\n\nCons:\n\n - The performance is pretty shit, so you will probably have to play with lower simulation settings, which aren't that good. Duh.\n\n - The base game is bland. Game is driven entirely by the workshop and your ability to create your own contraptions. Not a problem for me, maybe a problem for someone else.\n\n - The game can get boring pretty quickly because the loop is repetitive: spawn human, kill, repeat. This is coming from someone with over 400 hours played.\n\n - Not really game related, but if you don't like sticking around in communities that are often toxic, childish, annoying and the members are often kids or younger teens [spoiler](I would name a few examples but I feel like angering more than 1 fandom is a death sentence)[/spoiler], then avoid the community and stay away as far as possible and just grab your mods and run. Avoid the workshop comment sections, or just a lot of stuff in the workshop, the community tab, etc. It's just full of self-entitled kids who think they're hot shit.\n\n- Not sure how true this is nowadays, but some things on the workshop are just like farm spam, meaning the trending page was often filled with spam.\n\nRead the comments for anything I possibly missed to add but someone else mentioned.\n\nIn short:\nBuy the game if you like violence and looking like a crazy person that people wanna avoid from fear. It's pretty cool.\nDon't buy it if you aren't interested in that.\n\n[spoiler]The only reason I enabled comments is to possibly show how correct the community point is.[/spoiler]\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- Finished pillars of eternity 1 as a priest of berath, pledging my soul to the god of cycles, life and death. Promising to release the thousands of captured souls back to the wheel of reincarnation at the end of the game.\n\nStarted pillars of eternity 2, only to find out I was murdered after the events of the first game by a god who was believed to have been slain during the saints war. \n\nMy soul then comes face to face with the god I have devoted my life to, the god of life, death, and reincarnation.\n\nAfter a brief discussion about how I kept my promise at the end of the first game, my favoured god revealed to me he wants me to come back to life and serve him once again, and slay the being that killed me.\n\nI refused. It is only right that my soul is allowed to be reborn and return to the cycle, as I have worshipped this diety my whole life.\n\nMy god agreed. I was reborn as a wolf and the credits of Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire started to roll.\n\nPretty short game but 10/10\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...\n- [h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!\n- This game should have easily swept the game awards for art and theme.  \nthe mechanics, music, visuals, and story blend together flawlessly to communicate the experience of bitter ruin and abrupt descent into calamity.  The gameplay loop is pretty standard for a party based RPG.  Prepare, Enter the dungeon, kill the monster, loot, gain power, then do it again in a tougher dungeon.  The sanity system, very good writing and voice acting personalize the experience and keep you locked in your gaming chair anxious to delve deeper into just how bad things really are.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- The Forest is all about surviving and getting out alive but, now that I finally did it, I can't wait to get back to it in the upcoming sequel!\n\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*] Exceptional exploration with no hand holding.\n[*] Caves that are better dungeons than those in most RPG games.\n[*] Ambient audio.\n[*] The forest can really look gorgeous.\n[*] Unpredictable A.I. makes the natives look and feel threatening\n[*] Simple but functional crafting system.\n[*] Original and fun inventory design.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Impolished/buggy.\n[*] Could use more hotkeys.\n[*] Enemies in the caves should respawn.\n[*] Enemies in the middle of my base should not.\n[*] Items respawning in the same place are easily exploitable and kind of silly.\n[/list]\n\n\nWhat you're probably thinking is that The Forest is a survival focused game where you're supposed to build a fort and simply persist. Cant blame you for I was under the same impression until I got my hands on the game.\nWhile survival can be the name of the game, me and my friends led mostly nomadic lives, building only what was necessary to spend the night while catering only to the most basic needs and staying constantly on the move throughout the peninsula and its network of underground caves in pursuit of our goals.\nIt is up to you to choose how you want to play and set your own pace for exploration as The Forest's gameplay is flexible and free-form. I'd say it was more of an adventure than a survival game for most of us but, that does not have to apply to you and your band of brothers.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the exploration the most and can't even remember all of the times that The Forest left me gasping in amazement. Successfully navigating through and surviving the perils of the cave systems felt like a rewards of it's own to which the frequent “lore chunks” and occasional gear upgrades were more of a cherry on top.\nThe lack of hand holding greatly amplified the reward and the experience for me as everything we did, every cave that we successfully navigated and went through felt like it was 100% our doing as there were no “arrows” guiding our way to take the credit, and the moderate consumption and distribution of previously prepared rations encouraged us to embark on another expedition and conquer the peninsula and all of it's nook's and cranny's, one by one.\n\n\nOther than exploration, there's also a simple yet sufficient base building aspect to The Forest.\nCutting down trees to make walls and huts, getting familiar with, harvesting and eventually cultivating local flora (and even some fauna) comes with advantages of their own – as well as the consequences.\nSure, it's great to have a place called home but should you stay in it for too long and make a ruckus while doing it, be prepared to deal with your new and openly unhappy neighbors.\n\nThe natives will take actions proportionate to yours (or so it seemed to us) so if you desecrate their hunting groves or over-expand into their territory, be prepared for more than a couple of sleepless nights. Also keep in mind that violence breeds violence so, if it's not necessary or in self-defense, try not to cast the first stone. Cowering in the nearby bushes or simply running away is probably the best option - unless you crave bloodshed.\n\nOne last thing to mention is that, unlike most games dabbling in the survival genre, The Forest actually has the beginning and the ending. It even provides the player with optional activity that will encourage exploration and investigation which I highly recommend doing as it will shed some light on the history of the the land and events that took place there.\nWhether it's a good story or a mediocre one, well, that's up for you to decide but I can say that I really liked it and that it definitely wasn't a bad one. Those of you who liked [spoiler]“LOST”, the TV show, you will most likely appreciate this one. Bullsh!t ending not included.[/spoiler]\n\n\nStill having doubts? I say pick it up!\nSupport the small, creative team and help them make a sequel worthy of The Forest. I personally can't recommend it enough.\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- Really fun for the first few rounds... Then the game changes your control scheme without telling you, and with no way to turn it back. This has lead to several hours of frustration, trying to revert it. From what I've read, this is 'intended' to make the game more difficult, but really, is just incredible stupid. If I wanted the game to be more difficult because of a more annoying control scheme, I'd play with a god damn dance pad.\n\nThe game is really fun, but this has frustrated me to the point that I can't enjoy it any more unless it's fixed, and therefore I can't recommend it either\n- ~ DIFFICULTY ~\n\n🔲 My 90 year old grandma could play it\n🔲 Easy\n🔲 Normal\n✅ Hard\n🔲 Dark Souls\n\n~ GRAPHICS ~\n\n🔲 MS Paint\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Meh\n🔲 Graphics don't matter in this game\n✅ Good\n🔲 Beautiful\n🔲 Masterpiece\n\n~ MUSIC ~\n\n🔲 Bad\n🔲 Not special\n🔲 Good\n✅ Beautiful\n\nI WILL GIVE YOU MY ALL! and also FLAMES OF LOVE is a hit\n\n~ STORY ~\n\n🔲 This game has no story\n🔲 Like playing Temple Runners for the story\n✅ It's there for the people who want it\n🔲 Well written\n🔲 Epic story\n🔲 Imagine Kingdom Hearts but on crack\n\n~ PRICE ~\n\n🔲 Free\n🔲 Underpriced\n✅ Perfect Price\n🔲 Could be cheaper\n🔲 Overpriced\n🔲 Complete waste of money\n\nIt went free on some point\n\n~ REQUIREMENTS ~\n\n🔲 You can run it on a microwave\n✅ Average\n🔲 High end\n🔲 NASA computer\n\n~ LENGTH ~\n\n🔲 Very Short (0 - 2 hours)\n🔲Short (2 - 15 hours)\n🔲 Average (15-50 hours)\n🔲 Long (50-90 hours)\n🔲 Extremely long (90-110 hours)\n✅ No ending\n\n~ FUN ~\n\n🔲 I'd rather watch paint dry\n🔲 Hard to enjoy\n🔲 Repetitive\n🔲 Actually pretty amusing\n🔲The kind of fun you'll remember\n✅ Ride of your life\n\n~ REPLAYABILITY~\n\n🔲 It's a one-time experience\n🔲 Only for achievements\n🔲 If you wait a few months/years\n✅ Definitely\n🔲 Infinitely replayable\n\n~ WORTH BUYING ~\n\n🔲 No\n✅ Wait for sale\n✅ Yes\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- Why do people think they are funny and rating something in the opposite direction to what is obviously their true opinion?  There should be a rule against that.  Oh ya, and the \"game\" is cringe-worthy.  Get it for $0.01 and mine it for $0.04 worth of cards.\n- I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:\n\n1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on  \n2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure\n3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects\n4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues\n5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view\n6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet\n7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution\n8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again...

It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- if you love trpgs but are getting tired of all the great indie devs emulating ogre tactics and ff tactics while wondering where the fire emblem/langrisser love is at then this is your game. It is hands down THE best non-fire emblem game that falls under the latter category of styles and punches so far above its weight class that at one point while playing i idly wondered if they poached an intelligent systems game designer or something (they didnt).\n- \"Do not ask, 'Is Pizza Tower worth my time?' Instead ask, 'Am I worth Pizza Tower's time?'\"\nSun Tzu- Art of War\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Been playing now for 56 hours and love it apart from one thing.... too many press conferences! Seems like every other minute I'm told I'm due to go into a press meeting... so, apart from that, I'm enjoying the game. Have to confess as a 60 year old woman, I do cheat... have much fun creating a team, buying loads of top players and winning every match... so satisfying! Anyway, can't cope with the action games and find the pace of this right up my street. Have been playing since the original Championship Manager games back in the 90s so would call myself a fairly seasoned player!\n- 12 years have passed and you decide to update the game by increasing the price, removing multiplayer, radio stations, and adding your shitty launcher, yet you haven't fixed those frame drop issues that have been sticking with us since release and make the game completely unplayable no matter what computer you're running it on.\n\n12 years for this. Fuck you Rockstar.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- It's a cute point and click.\nI am salty though that it's tagged \"choices matter\" as they most certainly do not\n- Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- In all honesty, I became a little bored in the middle of playing it. It wasn't until I was almost through with the story that I realized why it had gotten such high ratings. You have no idea how hard it hit me when I realized why he was at the hospital [him being at the hospital is not a spoiler btw], and how relieved I was when he had at last found peace. It was in that moment that I had no regrets in purchasing it and how it was worth my time. Despite how brief the game was, I'm gonna remember it for a while. \n\n\n- I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.\n- [b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- +Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.\n- nice game but pls improve ur anti cheat\n- Yume Nikki is a game that is better spent playing blind through. If you are thinking of playing this game, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE FOR ANY HINTS. There is no losing the game, and there is no winning the game, but if you look at youtube, you will lose a lot of the thematic feel of the game.\n\nI REPEAT, DO NOT LOOK AT YOUTUBE OR ANY OTHER GUIDE. YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life. I heartily reccomend this game to those who like mystery and speculation.\n- This isn't a game. This is the beginning of a crippling JRPG series addiction. 10/10.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- horrible very very very very bad bad grafics fps and game play \nbut if you can play the game better do it i can watch jacksepticeye play it\n- Do yourself a favor if you get eye-strain or nauseated from the forced motion blur and/or the chromatic aberration and go to %appdata%/Local/FinchGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and open the \"Engine.ini\" file and copy in the following:\n\n[/Script/Engine.RendererSettings]\nr.SceneColorFringe.Max=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\n\nThis will disable both effects which in my case completely removed any strain I was having.\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- + The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane\n+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.)\n+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean\n+ Too many achievements to count for\n+ Too many hours spent in perspective\n+ Best poop simulator EVER!\n\n- Incompatible with social life outside the PC.\n- UPDATE: Had the music on the \"+\" but moved it here. Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating. Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack.\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!\n- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- Think you’re good at racing? Well, this game will give you a RKO.\n\nI don’t even know much about rally when I bought the game. I just see cars driving at dirt, weaving steering left and right constantly, and thought it looks cool. \n\nThis game is HARD. The learning curve is really steep. The first time I played, I constantly fly off a cliff and hug into trees. Because i don’t understand what my co driver is reading. He talk so fast that my tiny brain couldn’t process in time, sometimes I’m so confused that I go straight in junction because I can’t remember he said turn left or right. The cars are constantly out of control. \n\nAfter I learned about weight transfers that I’m able to start utilizing oversteer into corners. No more cripple into finish line with two tyres missing, that’s when the fun begins. Dirt Rally 2.0 is different from other racing games. You don’t race against other drivers, instead you race against time. If you turn off the hud, then it’s only you and the road, and TREES :)\n\nThe sound of the gravel hitting under your car. Dirt stained on your car as you progress through out the stage. The pops and bang coming out of exhaust when you shift. These combination feels somehow relaxing and satisfying at the same time.\n\nThe only downside of Dirt Rally 2.0 is that it requires constant internet connection, even when most of its content are single player. I wouldn’t complain if the server is stable. But sadly it isn’t. The server down happen quite frequently. Imagine you feel like you completed a 10 minutes perfect run, no crashes or mistakes. But then the game refuses to connect to the server. So the game won’t record your progress. It’s like a big middle finger to the player. \n\nI could make this review a thumbs down solely for the “always online” requirement, cuz it makes the player experience kinda inconsistent, but the gameplay itself does make up for it though. I mean when it works, it works remarkably well.\n\nApart from always online issue. Dirt Rally 2.0 is fantastic, the handling, physics, graphics etc. everything is on point. If you’re interested, buy the GOTY edition, it easily double the contents of the original game had. Worth every single cents.\n- A missed opportunity. But, if you liked the original, you'll like this one as well.\n\nGreat graphics and sound, just like its predecessor. Once again, bonus points for ultrawide support. No complaints about the presentation, but some of the characters definitely rub me the wrong way. YMMV in that department. \n\nI had read that the original writer passed away. I see this left the team with a difficult choice. To their credit, I could not tell the difference between the two. It emulates the same style and tone, and I imagine this is intentional to honor the spirit of the original author's intent. Unfortunately, I think the writing was the worst part of the original by far, and I see this as a missed opportunity to move on from that. \n\nAll of the supernatural elements in this story are but the thinnest of veils for what is ultimately a collection of modern day social media discourse. There is rampant virtue signaling, and every character speaks about the world around them as if they live inside Twitter. There are a scant few genuine moments, and I can appreciate the fact that the writer(s?) clearly feel a lot of angst about putting themselves out there and the creative process in general. There is a complete lack of subtlety in the writing regarding this, but I see it and I get it. \n\nIt feels a lot more disappointing than the first one, as we're familiar with much of the cast already, and there's not a lot of progress or poignancy in their respective narratives. I genuinely came away from this game feeling like I spent a few hours reading Twitter threads. It's nothing but surface level social commentary.\n\nGiven that the intent here was probably to honor the original writer, I'd still be in for a Coffee Talk 3 in the hopes that they show some growth and try something different. If that one also ends up being the same, I'd definitely call it quits. \n\nFWIW, this is certainly a worthy tribute for those who do not find fault with the original.\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.\n- [h1] Violence is never the answer. Violence is the question. And the answer is, yes. [/h1]\n\nDoom Eternal is a masterpiece of gore and violence, a pure art form of killing demons in almost any way imaginable, it took what the first game had and cranked it all to the maximum.\n\nThe combat is faster, and even more brutal, with absolutely stunning glory kill animations that never get old. It makes you use every single gun and master them, the Arenas are made to test every ounce of your mastery, they are fun/beautifully designed, yet exceedingly challenging, every single game mechanic WILL by the end of the game be mastered (that's what it took me to beat nightmare difficulty).\n\n[h1] Mick Gordon, the only thing i fear is you  [/h1]\n\nGordon has single-handedly carried both Doom 2k16 and Doom Eternal, this man's soundtracks make the combat and gore achieve ungodly amounts of insanity and adrenaline, some of these tracks are my favorite's and i listen too them everyday, but i think he did a better job in 2k16, it had much more \"unique\" tracks compared to Eternal.\n\n[h1] Doom Eternal and the Quest for Ammo  [/h1]\n\nThis game has insanely low amounts of ammo compared too 2k16. You will have to chainsaw a lot while playing to get the ammo back, this was enough for the game to be refunded by a good amount of people.\n\nI can understand, and i agree, there have been many times that i had to run across the arena to chainsaw kill a guy for ammo, i personally don't mind this at all, and i love the glory kill animations, but this could prove to be a big problem for some people.\n\n[h1] Buying Doom Eternal isn't a question, it's the answer  [/h1]\n\nWhile it has ammo problems, the rest of the game shines brilliantly, a polished masterpiece of demon killing and violence, i believe if you can give this game a fair try, you won't be able to go back too Doom 2k16, atleast i can't.\n- A very easy game to get into, super popular at the moment so there is always someone to play with, and for only 5 EUR you can invest a lot of hours into the game\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:\n\n1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on  \n2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure\n3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects\n4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues\n5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view\n6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet\n7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution\n8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.)

Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
