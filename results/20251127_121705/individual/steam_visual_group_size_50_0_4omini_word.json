      "Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.",
      "If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",
      "Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]",
      "This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.",
      "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.",
      "How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.",
      "A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n",
      "Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.",
      "Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.",

When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has.

      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",

      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",

      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions.

If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".",
      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",
      "As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos. This game is perfect for children who like to boast in the YouTube comments section about how they're smarter than everyone else because they get good grades in middle school and build elaborate structures in minecraft. If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.",
      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",

      "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",
      "I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.",

      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",
      "Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game.

      "Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.",
      "You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.",
      "A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.",

      "Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves",
      "Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck",
      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",
      "Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.",
      "Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game.

      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",
      "You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game.

      "From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.",
      "I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.",

All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.",

      "TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.",
      "[h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels.

Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]",
      "My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.",

      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",

      "Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.",
      "A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.",
      "First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!",
      "It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.",
      "I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.",
      "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",

      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",
      "The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game.

This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously.

If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters.

      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate.

Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.",
      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...",

      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",
      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",

      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
      "Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended",
      "[b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize.

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",

      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO.

      "If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.",
      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake."

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.\n- If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl.

Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:\n- Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- [strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n\n- Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.\n- Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- Climbed some rocks\nClimbed hot rocks\nClimbed cave rocks\nClimbed windy rocks\nClimbed snowy rocks\nHad an existential crisis\n\nIn conclusion, good game\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- [h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos. This game is perfect for children who like to boast in the YouTube comments section about how they're smarter than everyone else because they get good grades in middle school and build elaborate structures in minecraft. If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Love Anemone\nLove Cal\nLove Tangent\nLove Dys\nLove Marz\nLove Tammy\nLove Sym\nLove Nomi\nLove Rex\nWe don't talk about Vace\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. \n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.\n- \"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n\n【グループB】\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.\n- i bought a fighting game and ended up playing dress-up\n- **DAY 1 REVIEW**\n!!There is no game here yet!! \nCan't get into a server (they aren't full usually empty) \nOnce you manage to make it in you cant gather any resources\nThe game has a harder time running than starfield\nYou can jump and sometimes not get rubber banned back\nThe game looks nothing like the screenshots displayed on the store \n\n\nI will update once they make substantial updates and there is something to talk about\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- [h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]\n- My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!\n- Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!\n- If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- plz,plz,plz, add a way to easily see what wrong with your car. i built my car and it wont shift into gear, NOW I HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE FUCK NUT TO SEE WHAT WRONG. i have never felt so betrayed,let down, exaughtsed,hatered, and regret.\nkill me\n\nedit, nvm i just dont know how to drive\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.\n- If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:\n- Heavily recommended game! And the following play-through should make you either highly appalled or very interested:\n\n- Started off with a monkey as a pet. Named her \"Butters\", but later on my pet monkey took a liking to another guy named Bones. It made me a tiny bit sad.\n- Built a nice settlement, made the entire surroundings and buildings out of the easiest findable supply around: wood.\n- Ended up with 5 villagers after having successfully defended our 'village' a couple of times and converted 2 of the pirate prisoners to join our cause. They eventually did.\n\n(I'm skipping the story about the micromanagement and supply hoarding business - you'll learn about this on the spot yourself.)\n\n- I thought I had things going smoothly. Perhaps a bit too flawless. Characters got along well and two of them actually married eachother early on. It was a joyful moment for Bones and Greta. Bones had a dislike for clothes, so he was always running around naked which was not appreciated by some. But apparently he had a passion for farming and was well endowed. Greta took the earliest opportunity and showed him some loving. Greta was listed as a lazy and weapon hating person, but not too lazy to chase down some 'bone'. Good for her.\n- My self created character, named Adante, was a tireless fat miner and the other two people named Dorothy and Hunter were your average run of the mill converted prisoners from earlier battles. Dorothy could cook up some decent meals and Hunter, well, as the name implies, he was hunting down the animals for the food to make nice meals mixed up with the harvested crops from our farms. Luxurious and plentiful meals of variety. Even salt was added for flavour.\n\nBut then an event changed the atmosphere quite rapidly:\n\n- A nasty cobra snuck into the settlement and had its fangs set on Butters, the pet Monkey, and I did not notice as I was looking to mine some shizzle.\n- They battled eachother like no tomorrow and the fight lasted quite long because by the time I had actually noticed, the pet monkey had all her limbs bitten off by the snake and was crying for help while still being pounded by the Cobra.\n- The sound of the monkey cries... it still traumatizes me to this day.\n- Bones probably noticed long before I did, but hey, he loves being naked and probably didn't want to risk being bitten in dangling places so did nothing to help out.\n- Hunter, however, eventually shot & killed the cobra before it could put a killing blow on the poor limbless cryin' monkey.\n- Butters was then picked up by Hunters, carried and put in Bones' room to keep him comfortable with some painkillers while we figure out a way to get his limbs back. There are ways in this game to do so, be it four wooden pegs or made out of other technology, but it takes some craftmanship to pull this off.\n- By the time that we've managed to construct these, an electric storm came down on the settlement as if it was telling us: YOUR INTENTIONS ARE NOBLE BUT THE MONKEY MUST DIE!\n\n(Now, here's a lesson I've learned: Never make your ENTIRE settlement out of wood.)\n\n- The storm caused fire to start and spread like wildfire.\n- All villagers were alerted and commanded to extinguish the fire.\n- The fire became so intense, and spread from the storages and houses straight to the farm area (and all over the entire map, all animals and trees on the entire map were burned alive.)\n- Now, the house in which Butters was still 'recovering' was also hit by the fire. I sent my main character Adante to help out but the fire enclosed the area in a rapid speed. My fat miner and his slow jigglywiggly runs could not win that race by a long shot. He was a hauler, not a speedy gonzalez. \n- Butters, the poor cursed monkey, just shrieked and screamed her lungs out when the fire was getting closer and closer after every second. \n- So within seconds, we could hear the cries again, of a pet Monkey. Not only in pain from snake bites and losing all limbs before, but now also jumping by the belly up & down inside her once comfortable pet-bed, being on fire.\n- Every villager probably had tears in the eyes from that whole ordeal once the fire started demanding the limbless body and a Monkey fighting for the last breath of her life. \n- I made Bones, since he's supposedly the new master of Butters, go into the flames and try to retrieve the monkey while the plan was to let him carry the monkey into the water at a nearby lake.\n- This turned Bones into a running naked man carrying a limbless monkey across the settlement, while both being on fire. \n- The outcome of this is probably easy to guess. They burned together, into (what it seemed) a neverending sea of flames and emotion.\n- I ordered all my other villagers to stand in the water of the lake and wait out the fire frenzy. They were all depressed and Greta simply lost it and ran into the firesea on her own accord due to severe depression.\n\nAfter the fire died, I stopped playing and told the story to my girlfriend. Her eyes opened wide and then the question came: \"What kind of f***ed up game is that?\"\n\nRimworld, my dear. It's Rimworld. -true story-\n\n[Edit review 21.04.2022] \nAs you can see I've been playing this game for another 2000 hours from the point of my initial review back in 2017. The game itself has grown so substantially and in so many positive directions. The modders play a great part in this as the content that is being made makes the game even more enjoyable. There will be more and more content in the future as well as more official DLC's which, to me, is very exciting. The maker(s) of the game together with the Rimworld community really made something special that will last you with endless of hours of amazing gameplay. I cannot praise this game higher than I already do and I highly recommend to anyone reading this that you give this a try!\n[End of edit]\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- [strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n\n- Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.\n- Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- Climbed some rocks\nClimbed hot rocks\nClimbed cave rocks\nClimbed windy rocks\nClimbed snowy rocks\nHad an existential crisis\n\nIn conclusion, good game\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.\n- A very good recursive Sokoban.

This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- They tried to do like super smash bros and generalize controls. So all (or jsut about)  characters play the same. The problem this causes is that it makes the game very repetitive and gets stale after 5h or so of gameplay.\n- Good game, one of the best in the series but I can not recommend. \nDO NOT BUY.\nWhile it is still possible to play zombies safely with the use of community patches you can not play public servers safely and activision are actively removing safe ways of playing the game.\n\n*DO NOT OPEN ANY COD PRIOR TO IW*\nThey took away Xlabs, Sm2, and soon will take away Plutonium which are all the ONLY safe way to play these older CoDs.\nOpening any CoD prior to IW will result in a chance for people to gain access to your pc. 2 security breaches are known:\nCVE-2018-20817\n(SV_SteamAuthClient in various Activision Infinity Ward Call of Duty games before 2015-08-11 is missing a size check when reading authBlob data into a buffer, which allows one to execute code on the remote target machine when sending a steam authentication request.

Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- [h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".\n- FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.\n- As a former astronaut, I find this game incredibly inaccurate and offensive to the profession. This game is massively simplified to a point in which rocket science may be likened to Legos. This game is perfect for children who like to boast in the YouTube comments section about how they're smarter than everyone else because they get good grades in middle school and build elaborate structures in minecraft. If you're a 12 year old who thinks you're the shit, this game is perfect for you; for anyone who is actually smart like myself, go to Harvard and use your time usefully learning astrophysics.\n- Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- I thought I liked this game....  but after completing about half, I am super bored.  I quit the game after every battle.\n\nDeck building is super basic and kinda pointless.   No reason to adjust deck after you complete a few maps.  The maps are super easy.\n\nYou can basically just run around with 1 unit and kill everything...   Since movement costs a card, you either move one unit many times, or many units 1 time.   Easier to just move 1 strong unit around.\n\nI think I am the wrong demographic.  The storyline is for kids.   So maybe the target audience is 10 year olds with no strategy gaming experience.\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- If you like management type games and RPGs, this is the perfect mix. It's just enough management to allow you to thrive with mostly strategy without feeling bogged down, and just enough RPG elements to get you invested in not just your squad, but each individual character in it. \n\nHere's a tale from my experience with the game;\n\nThis is the kind of game to change your entire perspective on life itself. Failure is not the end, nor the beginning, but a constant in this world that you can either let destroy you or make you stronger. Allow me to tell you a story. The story of New Battlehill. \nNear the Shek city of Squin, not far east, was a small town. It went through many names. The first that stuck was Firstyeet, totally not a placeholder. It wasn't an notable settlement, merely consisting of a shack, an iron processor, and some walls to mildly inconvenience the roving gangs of Dust Bandits that liked to bully the residents. After being evicted from their own city once again, the residents, Denver, Soto, Ruka, and Meow, vowed to take back their home. After training and buying the best weapons and armor they could, they made their way back to Firstyeet. To their surprise, however, they would not have to fight. One of the bandits had picked a fight with a herd of goats. The bandits' defense failed against the caprine assault. From this, the town would get its second name - Densorumego. Den for Denver. So for Soto. Ru for Ruka. Me for Meow. And Go for the true heroes, the goats.\nPeace would not last long but soon the residents of Densorumego would become strengthened by their constant fighting. On the elevated, somewhat round land on which Densorumego sat, there were many large fights involving a lot of people. If only there was some sort of name to reflect this... \nAnd from that, the town was renamed for the last time, to Battlehill.\nThings were looking up. The town built its first farms and expanded to be almost four times its original size. But this peace would not last. Battlehill's new ambitions of self sufficiency would attract the attention of a new foe - The Shek Kingdom.\nThe Shek claimed ownership of the land Battlehill was on, and as such, demanded all food grown there be given to them. Confident from their many victories against the Dust Bandits, the Battlehillites refused the Shek demands. Their risk was calculated... but man were they bad at math.\nAll but one were nearly killed in the ensuing battle, and the one person that wasn't knocked into a coma was stuck on the wall because part of the wall was destroyed and he could no longer reach the stairs because of that. The people knew they couldn't fight the Shek, but they would not allow themselves to be subservient either. And so began their malicious compliance. The Shek would get all the food in Battlehill, as it would be none - The Battlehillites were moving.\nI could write entire books about their journey around the west. The Fogmen, the ruins, the Screeching Bandits, there's many a tale. But, eventually, the people would find a new home. In the harsh and Beak Thing infested land of Vain, homeland of the Western Hive, they would found their new home - New Battlehill.\nJump to now, the city is thriving, they have more bread than they know what to do with, they've grown strong from defending their home from the Beak Things, and their population has grown. They are currently planning a reconquest of Battlehill, which was occupied by Dust Bandits shortly after they left.\n\nThere is a part I left out, between Firstyeet and Densorumego - I had repeatedly failed to retake Firstyeet, and I was about to quit the game. I was frustrated that I'd gone and bought the best arms and armor and still failed. And when I tried to set up a training ground on a mountain near Squin, bandits again came and defeated me. I went as far as to try and get a refund, which was denied. That refund being denied was the best thing that could've happened. I decided to give the game another try, and to try accepting my failures and growing from them. And if I hadn't done that, I would never have founded New Battlehill. None of the legend worthy tales my squad has been through would have happened. And I'd never have had the fun of going through all of them.\n\nIn short, get this game. It is just great.\n- Love Anemone\nLove Cal\nLove Tangent\nLove Dys\nLove Marz\nLove Tammy\nLove Sym\nLove Nomi\nLove Rex\nWe don't talk about Vace\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. \n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.\n- \"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.\n- Normally, I am hard-set on if a game is good, or bad. This game? its in the middle. I mean, a lot of the game is actually really cool, it looks great, it doesn't explain why basically almost every single person is a walking hunk of muscle, but there are some serious flaws. Not just the weird ones like \"kitchen knives break after you stab someone 3 times\" or \"I just ran over an entire sidewalk of people, and the police are nowhere to be found\", but some seriously terrible glitches that make the game unplayable. Such as the whole space-car thing. \"lalala... driving along the road...\" all of the sudden KABAM your car goes flying, hits the ground, explodes, you die, and you get charged money. You use a car to try and get back to where you were going, and BANG same thing happens again. Also, the cops, even though they are extremely spread out and don't appear to have any form of 911 or anything, are nuts with guns. You, who are supposed to be some sort of superultracop, don't even carry a knife. A FREAKING KNIFE. So if you want a gun, you have to kill a police officer, BUT WAIT HE DIDN'T DRAW HIS GUN AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE A HOLSTER so you have to wait until another police officer shows up, hope that he tries to shoot you instead of tackling you, and then run up to him while he shoots at you, press f when you are right in front of him, and grab his gun. Meanwhile the entire police force is going to where you are. Thats just how to get a pistol. Whats that? You want a real gun? One that doesn't take 7 shots(literally) to kill a unarmored policeman? Well, you have to hole up in some building, which its hard to find one with an interior, and just keep shooting the police officers when they charge in. Eventually, after maybe 30 officers are dead, they send in their \"elite team\" of guys... with no helmets... no armor other than a vest... and either a shotgun or a submachine gun. The farthest I have gotten to is with these guys dressed in all grey with helmets and assault rifles, they are meant to be the wall, because it can take up to an entire clip of your submachine gun to take one down. Oh, and back to the cars, WHAT THE HECK IS WITH THE CAR ATTACKING. It made me almost fall out of my chair laughing when I realized that I could use my car to \"lunge\" left and right, and take out other cars. I guess the devs didn't know that cars can't drive straight sideways. Your character has no weapons as well, so it looks kinda stupid when you are blocking and punching a bunch of guys with tire irons, knives, and whatnot. Oh yeah, the weapons break after you swing a few times. The game also has weird weapons. You can pick up an umbrella, a purse, heck even a grocery bag, or a take-out box, to use as a weapon, but these things are one use, and deal less damage then a punch. Overall, this game is a little too unrealistic, to the point where it really removes you from the game. Not to mention the glitches, you would think that the \"new and improved\" sleeping dogs would be \"new and improved\" not the horrible, glitchy mess it is now. I really tried to play it, but I just got tired of being gunned down while I am trying to break into a car and start it up, which takes like a good 20 seconds, which is a lot of time when you have 10 cops unloading their bottomless clips at you. I got tired of randomly being flung into space. I got tired of a cop arresting me, and instead of allowing me to break free and whatnot, me and the cop take a \"small adventure\" gliding across the road through cars and buildings. I got tired of a game thats supposed to be fixed and nearly glitchless, when in reality most early access games play better. I am sorry.\n- Not what the developers promised.\nFeels like a graphics mod for Chivalry.\n\nI'm not a fan of Chivalry either. I had some fun with it, but couldn't bear the clunkiness and wished for intuitive controls and realistic fights. Mordhau promised exactly that. \nAlthough it's equally clunky und even more buggy.\n\nAlso it doesn't offer the option to play in private rooms with your friends (duel mode) or only on paid servers. Inviting a friend to a local match should be a standard feature.\n\nAll the new content and features don't really matter - it's a PvP fighting game. I need only a couple of weapons that work, not 100+ that don't.\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- G.A.R.B.A.G.E\n\nuhm idk man, it was but it just isn't, you know? because I don't know??? lots of bugs, cinematics are rushed, game is rigged, friends cheat... FUCKS THIS SHIET\n- I've changed my mind on this review.\n\nLoot boxes? Yuck.\nRemoving most servers, forcing everyone onto US West/East and European servers? Yuck.\nBase 250 ping at all times? Yuck.\n\nI want my Oceanic server back, so I can actually enjoy the game properly. Until better region support is reintroduced, this'll remain a negative review.\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n\n【グループB】\n- 100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.\n- Doublefine: How did Psychonauts flop? Why did nobody buy our enjoyable artistic platformer?\nUs: You didn’t market it. Heck, I legit thought it was a horror game when I got it as a kid.\nDoublefine: Well, either way, now that it’s a cult classic – we made a sequel.\nUs: Awesome, when is that coming out anyway?\nDoublefine: It’s already out. We just didn’t market it again.\n- From my og demo feedback, not much changed sadly:\n\nOh boy....\n\nI will start with the most glaring issue:\n-It's friggin IMPOSSIBLE to find an online match\n\nNow some other stuff that I found odd or bad:\n-The camera.... oh god.... I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far. But, IT HAS POTENTIAL.\n\nSadly, another case of developer with TONS of feedback delivering an undercooked mess. Stay away from it.\n- I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.\n- i bought a fighting game and ended up playing dress-up\n- **DAY 1 REVIEW**\n!!There is no game here yet!! \nCan't get into a server (they aren't full usually empty) \nOnce you manage to make it in you cant gather any resources\nThe game has a harder time running than starfield\nYou can jump and sometimes not get rubber banned back\nThe game looks nothing like the screenshots displayed on the store \n\n\nI will update once they make substantial updates and there is something to talk about\n- [b]What was added:[/b]\n- Roguelike mode\n- New campaigns\n- 5 new units\n- Groove/Super groove\n- 4 new commanders\n- New OST, including Commanders'\n\n[b]What did it cost:[/b]\n- No more Arcade and Puzzles\n- A lot of maps removed from Multiplayer\n- Can't randomize weather anymore (????)\n- Can't use previous OST\n- No more Co-op campaign\n- Nothing to unlock with stars. All characters are already unlocked, so there is no point completing the campaign with more than 1 star per mission.\n\n[b]With that being said, here are some issues:[/b]\n- Balancing may need some work. Won't get into details, but it doesn't feel right, as it wasn't right in Wargroove\n- AI is still bad. Even worse than before. They just didn't touch it. They will use their Groove on cooldown most of the time, without bothering about the Supergroove. Commanders will run into you only to get surrounded and killed.\n- Once a player lose, all of his team lose, putting the game to an end. Though there is a toggle in map editor to disable it, but doesn't seem to work\n- A lot of tooltips missing for settings. We don't know what most settings are doing...\n- Tried to make a map where Commanders can respawn after 2 turns, to prevent AI to lose instantly, and let them play more agressive. But when you increment counters or set flags booleans, they get changed for both teams, making it impossible to script... Can't debug efficiently either.\n- The new Commanders' themes are glitchy when looping\n- The Codex didn't get updated properly. When selecting a Commander, we can only see a short text for the Groove, without any details.\n- In Map Editors, there are two entries for Wulfar, but using different names.\n\nI'd say if you liked Wargroove 1, you'd just like that one too. But it feels really disappointing right now. I don't know why they removed features instead of just adding new ones... In 2020, they said they were working on AI. But they did absolutely nothing.\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- [h1] Indie Mario Maker [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is a 2D platformer that's heavily focused on building, sharing, and playing user levels. For those of us that don't own a Nintendo Switch, this game is a fine replacement for the Mario Maker games, and might even be better? \n\n\n[h1] CHARACTER [/h1]\n\nThe controls feel pretty tight and fluid. There are a ton of powerups that you can use, and each of them serves a different purpose. Compared to mario powerups, there's some unique ones here. One powerup lets you wall jump, but also lets you sneak by enemies. Another has a jetpack and propellers. Levelhead allows for some decent precision and very rarely did I feel it was my character's fault when I died. \n\n\n[h1] CAMPAIGN [/h1]\n\nThe first main goal when you boot up Levelhead is to go through the extensive campaign. It's sort of a tutorial, but at the same time is fleshed out and takes a pretty decent amount of time to beat and has some challenge to it. From what I have played of the campaign, levels are fun and well designed. Now, I have played very little of the campaign, it's not what I purchased this game for. I asked a friend for a 100% save file so I could skip the campaign and go right to creating levels. Why did I do this? because of Levelhead's biggest problem: the unlock system. To unlock things to create levels with, you have to beat the campaign and find secrets. So basically they gated off Levelhead's largest appeal, the level editor, behind a campaign that's several hours long and requires you to do some secret hunting. I understand they did this for tutorial reasons, but it still annoys me. \n\n\n[h1] LEVEL EDITOR [/h1]\n\nOnce you finally get your hands on the level editor, you'll quickly notice how accessible and easy to use it is. The UI has nice big and understandable buttons. Almost everything is as simple as pressing left click on what you want and where. Even more complicated things such as a timer or a switch connected to a door are made very simple and understandable. It has to be the best level editor I've ever used, purely for the simplicity of it. \n\n\n[h1] SECOND GOAL [/h1]\n\nThe second primary goal of Levelhead is to create levels and have them become apart of The Tower. The tower is where all the good levels go, and you can sort levels there by difficulty, release date, tags, etc. First you have to get through the Marketing Depertment. To do this, you need Exposure Bux, which is a currency you earn while playing marketing department levels. It's a neat system that works pretty well and encourages you to play other people's levels. \n\n\n[h1] MINOR ISSUES [/h1]\n\nI wish you could name levels without using preset words. I understand why they did this (their target audience is young), but at times I have a genius level name and am unable to use it. Another issue is more of a community-based issue. A lot of the levels in the marketing department are garbage (including my own levels probably). It's kind of rough to sift through the mess to find great works. I also wish you could filter levels in the marketing department the same way you can in the tower. The Rumpus system for friending others is frustrating and borderline useless. People can't search others by name, but rather by a randomly generated code. All of these issues are pretty minor and don't effect the game enough to bother me too much.\n\n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\n\nLevelhead is absolutely worth owning, especially for those without a Switch. It's polished in nearly every way, and is just very fun to play. The price point is pretty high though, so possibly wait for a sale unless you think you desperately need to play this. Fully recommended!\n\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34946548/] Check out my curator! [/url]\n- My god.. Capcom did it. They saved the franchise. I'm honestly shocked. \n\nWhen the first teaser dropped I thought for sure this would just be a P.T. copy which I was sort of okay with. Turns out I was wrong. This is a classic Resident Evil game. Like, RE1 classic. Complete with puzzle solving, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, and tense stressful boss encounters. The game brings back the storage box system even! I can't stress enough how amazing this game is as a long time RE fan. If you're one too, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this one. Best game since RE4.... May even be better.\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- Play this game in roguelike mode (no extra lives) as that seems to be how it was designed. By letting objects of the same type touch each other you will be able to deal damage to or destroy them all with one move! Attacking enemies will damage you back so you have to use potions that also drop down to heal.\n\nI see some of the reviews here saying this game sucks and it's all randomness. It's a roguelike though, so there is a good deal of randomness but the fun comes from gaining skill with the mechanics and making the right decisions. If you can carve out lone pieces and allow a bunch of the same object to get into a big cluster, popping that huge chain is super satisfying. \n\nThe game was very intimidating at first and I would die in the first 2 stages over and over, but I eventually got the hang of things and beat the game for the first time pretty quickly. This game requires patience to get a hang of the mechanics but once you do it's a fun little time waster to open up every once in a while. There are lots of characters to unlock too and they all bring their own strategies to the table.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!\n- It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!\n- Don't let the horror tag scare you off; there are no jump scares, no over-the-top gore (there is some, but it's all pixels), nothing that leads to nightmares (at least not for me); and there are good endings too.\n\nA good story that takes about 4 hours to complete (including multiple endings -- there's a chapter select option after you finish so you don't have to replay the whole game). Some puzzles, a lot of cutscenes (all skippable, but worth reading). There's a lot of humour to be found in here too!\n- If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- i helped a little girl who talks like a mafia gangster get prizes from a crane game, then went a seedy bar to help a large, gay anime loving gator exorcise ghosts from his phone, then went a practice date with alligator Goro Majima.\n\nUpdate: After League of Legends made my girlfriend hate video games, Later Alligator made her love them again.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- plz,plz,plz, add a way to easily see what wrong with your car. i built my car and it wont shift into gear, NOW I HAVE TO CHECK EVERY SINGLE FUCK NUT TO SEE WHAT WRONG. i have never felt so betrayed,let down, exaughtsed,hatered, and regret.\nkill me\n\nedit, nvm i just dont know how to drive\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.\n- People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
