      "I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)",

      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!!

      "Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game",
      "This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.",

      "Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10",
      "From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.",
      "this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",

      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "[h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means.

It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one!

      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",

Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",
      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!",
      "Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!",
      "I just finished Metro 2033 Redux a while ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best things is that the game is COMPLETELY in a first person perspective, including the cutscenes. Reminded me of Bioshock Infinite a bit in that respect. You are fully immersed in your world. Except for the ending though..for some reason they chose to do a zoomed out pre-rendered cutscene there. \n\nI played on Survival mode (normal difficulty) and the challenge was decent. At one or two points in the game, it wasn't clear to me what to do (probably wasn't paying attention to the dialogues), but I like the no-hand-holding thing. At the last level as well, I ended up running out of filters (pretty sure I scoured all around for supplies and hit the limit many times) so that kinda took away from the experience a bit. \n\nBut otherwise, the story was good. Decent enemy variation. Stealth is possible against humans as well (game doesn't explicitly tell you this IIRC). Just make sure you crouch all the time and turn off your flashlight!\n\nCombat was great as well. The weapon handling felt really good. I found a quad-barrel shotgun and that was massive. Killed all Watchmen in a single shot! \n\nAtmosphere was realistic and well done. Performance was great as well on my humble GTX 750 (with medium settings). \n\nIt's hard for me to find fault with the game. I went in with little expectation, but then again I also don't play much FPS games. This is definitely better gameplay wise than Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line though.",
      "[h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn.

Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges.

      "I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.",
      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",
      "As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10",
      "Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"",
      "Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.",
      "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.",
      "Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.",
      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
      "Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.",
      "d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.",
      "How is this game so damned good?\nAnd for 3 bucks.\n\nVampire Survivors is setting a new bar for value in gaming. $70 for a new AAA game? Pfft. I think not. Not when games like Vampire Survivors are available.\n\nIt is fully functional on the Steam Deck.\n\nThis is an RPG Auto-battler enemy hell (bullet hell). You control the progression and pathing of your character, the game handles the actual combat, making for a near perfect synergy between game and gamer.\n\nThere are currently four main maps and then a bunch of specialty maps, one of which was almost definitely designed specifically to help you expedite your unlocks. Each has its own unique theme.\n\nUnlocks are the progression system in this one, and it works. Accomplishing almost any unique task or reaching certain levels will unlock the next things in line. However, character unlocks have an additional cost in gold (acquired in game). Similarly, permanent character boosts can be unlocked and all characters receive the benefits of all unlocks. There are even more things to unlock veyond those, and everything not only feels practical, but have a noticeable affect on gameplay.\n\nYou'd think that it being an enemy (read: bullet) hell, and with an array of abilities at your disposal, the screen would fill up quickly, and it does, but somehow, the devs managed to make your avatar noticeable and trackable no matter how high the screen chaos gets.\n\nSpeaking of which, for lofi graphics, these are just flat out cool. Again, it just works. The soundtrack mirrors this, and you'll be able to switch between tracks as you please. Additionally, I find this is a great game to play while jamming your own tunes.\n\nIn my opinion, the value at 3 bucks and the huge amount of gameplay variety make this a no brainer. You get far less from any number of full priced AAA titles. AND...the game hasn't even concluded development yet. What other surprises do the devs have in store, I wonder?\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated.

      "When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",

Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.",

Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3",
      "Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox.

Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online.

      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",

Nothing but amazing from what I've played from the demo. \n\nThe game also has this this subtle love for Lunar Silver Star Story. With the love of exploring /adventures. \n\nWhich is alone makes me fan. \n\nThe gameplay is just so rich, and very fun. You can't just sit there and press 1 button to attack. No. You have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus, and do some combos. Neat idea to stay on your 2 feet. \n\nThe music really good. Capture the world you're playing. \n\nTo every team who worked on this game, just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy. \n\n5 stars from what I've played, and if you're a fan of old school JRPG, then you owe to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry. \n\n\n\nHopefully Top 5 games this year for me? \n\nSea Of Stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself. \n\nBig Thumbs Up indeed!",

      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",
      "imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.",
      "Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.",
      "We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".",

      "Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10",
      "Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.",

With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]",
      "[h1]THIS GAME HAS COMMUNITY SERVERS WITHOUT HACKERS.[/h1]\n\nI've been seeing a lot of reviews talking about this game being [i]\"infested with hackers, can't go a single game without hackers, hackers ruining everything\"[/i] etc. but I have yet to see a single hacker in any of my games because I play in community servers. I actually put off going back to this game for the longest time because of these reviews and thought there were only official servers, but I was completely wrong, [b]THERE ARE STILL ACTIVE COMMUNITY SERVERS WITH ADMINS ACTIVELY MONITORING FOR HACKERS.[/b]\n\nI genuinely don't understand why nobody is mentioning the fact that there are community servers, literally none of the top reviews say so. The only reason I didn't go back to this game any sooner was because of this one misconception, but to reiterate, [b]THERE ARE COMMUNITY SERVERS,[/b] just like Battlefield 4, which is the primary reason why BF4 is still alive to this day.\n\n[u]Completely ditch the matchmaking/official servers and just use the server browser,[/u] [b]I HAVE YET TO RUN INTO A SINGLE HACKER BECAUSE OF THIS.[/b] Anyone leaving a negative review because of \"hackers\" are probably still playing on official servers and are most likely just garbage at the game. [b]It's very easy to be really good at this game lmao.[/b]\n\n[u]The game is still very much alive and well without hackers[/u] and is one of the most fun/immersive FPS games ever made.\n\nEdit: I've played this game since launch on Origin and easily have over 200 hours, I only just this week started playing again on Steam for convenience, since low hours matters to some people lol.",
      "One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n",
      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",

      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".",

      "Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?",

      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.",

      "This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
      "I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.",
      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!",

Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.",
      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
      "11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.",
      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",
      "I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",
      "I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.",

      "This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",

      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]",

      "Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso ..

      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",

The world is gorgeous, detailed and worth exploring. The stories are exciting and incredibly well written. The combat has seen many changes, increasing the skill ceiling and giving the player more options and strategies to work with. The OST is quite frankly a masterpiece, simple as that. \n\nThere's so much more to say about this fantastic game and all the improvements and changes they made, but it will be much better if you see it for yourself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, even at full price. 8/8",
      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game.

      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",

      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",

      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",

      "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.",
      "(This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!",
      "What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.",
      "This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.",
      "I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic). Probably 5.5/10 for now and I'll revise when i get the English experience?",
      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",

Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10.

      "Why did i get this game???\n\nWell.. Mainly because i've always liked seeing those big trucks driving by me, So i wondered what it would feel like driving a big tractor trailer, And so i got this!\n\nHonestly, I can't say if it's anything like a real truck, But this game does get very very complicating when it comes to parking with your 53' container, And it makes me wonder, Wow! Those guys must really have some good practice! Because if i can't do it here, I for sure wont be able to do it in real life! xD\n\nMultiplayer is super fun as well, Driving next to other truck drivers and then honking at them, or meeting new friends, SOME actually truck drivers, and then traveling with them, Stopping to weight your freight, getting gas and such, It's a very fun experience.\n\nHonest Rating: 10/10 As of right now, Because I feel like i haven't played enough to experience any problems or bugs, But the game is very fun!! ***ONLY IF YOU LOVE SIMULATOR GAMES, If you don't, Then maybe think twice, But I enjoy simulator games.*** And if you want to give this game a try as your first Simulator game, Then i would recommend it!\n\nRecommendable? Yes, I recommend it to people who want to give Simulator games a try, This is a perfect one. (Or Euro Truck Simulator) Although if you're from the USA i recommend this one, Because Euro Truck Simulator has different driving rules than US, So you might get tickets for some things you don't know lol..",
      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",

Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere.

So many missions to complete, so many enemies to kill, so much loot to grab. You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through.

The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora. It also has one of the most badass, charasmatic and handsome villians of all time... [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]So many reasons to replay this game. Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text).

Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

      "So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually.

      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",

      "Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",
      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",

A Potterhead’s wet dream made manifest.\n\n- Varied and satisfying combat system that constantly opens up new opportunities as you learn more spells, and stays fresh, engaging in the long run.\n\n- Excellent customization possibilities, featuring a myriad of cosmetics and skins, other than your very own customizable ‘base’ to furnish by hand at leisure.\n\n- Exciting progression that portrays your growth as a wizard (or witch) rather well, giving you new tools and utilities to access previously-locked content and areas.\n\n- Solid roster of side characters; most of them are likable / unique enough, and incredibly, their writing isn’t complete garbage - kudos to that.\n[/td]\n[td]\n- Excessively repetitive open-world activities in the long run, that create bloat and annoyance for those who want to complete all side activities.\n\n- Combat balance issues with potions, ‘healing spam’ and unforgivable curses: especially when upgraded they prove overpowered and make most fights quite too easy.\n\n- Most named foes and quest bosses (but not all) are just normal enemies on steroids, that don’t vary in mechanics and don’t have unique behaviors.\n\n- Some inconsistencies with lore and character behavior. Example: if you use unforgivable curses in public or during quests (with witnesses), nobody will give a damn.\n\n- Underwhelming finale that doesn’t really reflect the importance of what you accomplished, and doesn’t give any detail about how your actions influenced other characters afterwards.\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]🟨 [b]Bugs & Issues[/b][/th]\n[th]🔧 [b]Specs[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]\n- Significant frame-drops inside Hogwarts when transitioning between different sections, and also in specific places throughout the castle, regardless of settings.\n\n- In some cases, fall damage doesn’t register on enemies.\n[/td]\n[td]\n- 3900X\n- 2080Ti\n- 32GB RAM\n- SSD\n- 1440p\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td][b]Content & Replay Value:[/b][/td]\n[td]It took me 82 hours to complete Hogwarts Legacy, taking considerable extra time to clear all optional content and find around 90% of collectibles / secrets on Hard difficulty.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.",
      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "they should pay me to be playing this lmao",
      "This is not a video game.\n\nIt is not a movie, or a book, or a painting, or a song.\n\nThis is a Journey.\n\nThis is why video games as a medium need to exist. The ability to tell a story through symbolism, music, environment, and player freedom all at the same time. \n\nI didn't play journey when it came out on consoles. I couldn't afford one. I couldn't even afford a computer back then. But I watched it. I watched let's plays and interviews and I was actually listening to the Journey soundtrack when I saw, after nearly 8 YEARS, that this was available on Steam. \n\nJust buy it. This is like Harry Potter, or the Last of Us, or the Mona Lisa. You almost owe it to yourself to at least check it out.\n\nEdit: Okay a lot of people have been hanging on the whole Avengers comparison so I removed it. I thought it was obvious that Journey is not a superhero simulator.\n\nA museum centuries from now will have an exhibit where people watch and play Journey.",
      "You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.",
      "Nice enough game with a lot of lovely content..\nCan be stunning in places.... Real pleased I was able to buy it.\n\nVaried gameplay; tons of options... Bots to Live MultiPalyer Ops at the flick of a switch.\n\nRuns great on my 3-year old rig with a newish GPU (GTX1070).\nHas a few things a few percent of people with strange expectations are ungrateful about..\n\n1) The Game is designed to look even better on future hardware (such as the very recently released GTX1080Ti).\n2) A GOOD rig is required to run this game. A top i5 or an i7 is going to be the way to go. No potatoes.\n3) It did run nicely on Medium settings on my 3y/o Haswell i5 R9 280 Crossfire rig... No complaints there.\n4) You NEED a Good Internet connection. We have Fiber-Optic and have no connection issues in the Far East.\n5) A GTX1070 Will run it nicely on Pretty High settings; assuming you have a good Motherboard & upated Drivers.\n6) Make sure you install the game on a good Gaming-Hard-Drive/SSD, and not on some rusty old File Drive.\n7) Enjoy.... \n    ...it might take a while to get your head around all the details of the game and what to do, but that`s good. \n \nOh, and yes there are a couple of bugs.. \nThose of us who re-map cannot steer the motorcycles.\nThere is no Mapping for the 6-Home/End Keys.... for some unknown reason.\nThere may be others I have not found yet.",
      "Sitting here at 2 am, gazing at the glowing screen, having just finished Kentucky: Route Zero, I blink and hesitate. I retype this paragraph several times. I push away from the table, stumble into kitchen, pour some bourbon trying not to clink the bottle against the glass. My wife is asleep in the next room and I loathe to disturb her dreams.\n\nI will not insult this game with such banalities as rating or vulgar list of pros and cons. Doing all that would be like rating a poem by word count, very accurate and of absolutely no use to anyone.\nI can only describe Kentucky: Route Zero as a feeling. Shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, a lump in a throat.  A slight vertigo. It's that acceptance that comes after the anger, when you're putting everything in order in preparation. A longing for the good old times that never were and you only imagined them and kept thinking about them until they seemed real. It's coming back to your parents' home for a funeral. It's that sinking feeling you get when you close a book you just finished and the real world reasserts itself. \nI could go on, but what's the point? I'm writing this more for myself than anyone else.\n\nKentucky: Route Zero put a splinter in my heart. It's not big or harmful, but it's there and every once in a while it hurts.",
      "This innocent-looking golf game really is not a golf game. Except it is a golf game. Except it isn't. Essentially, WTG? uses \"golf game\" as its medium, through which it tells a staggering number of jokes and punchlines. Expect the unexpected. But always expect there to be puns.",
      "Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!",
      "please don't give an ironic positive review for this \"game\". It truly deserves the tag of \"overwhelmingly negative\" reviews.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",
      "There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.",
      "Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.",
      "Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "\"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.",
      "I realise this is intended to be a darkly humored game, but it is still fucked up nonetheless. I just can't fathom how such degraded humor can be seen as funny.",
      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n",
      "I've played a fully modded GOG version of Planescape: Torment and within 5 minutes of playing this Enhanced Edition version, I can say that the clear winner goes to the Enhanced Edition because of the following Quality of Life improvements:\n\n1) Tab reveals all interatable objects with subtle icons to indicate which interaction will happen if object is clicked on  \n2) Mouse scrollwheel WORKS, which is SO GREAT for such a dialogue heavy adventure\n3) The popup dialogue boxes when examining objects aren't center screen, but hover above the objects\n4) Alt+Tab toggling without any issues\n5) Other programs or Desktop icons no longer occasionally flicker into view\n6) The sound hasn't cracked or glitched yet\n7) The HUD and icons are super polished and are set to the perfect size and resolution\n8) Game is super polished, but will only become more polished over time",

      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",
      "Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it! The music is there, the humor is there, and it's the perfect combination of nostalgia and fresh. The puzzles so far are fun and the inclusion of a hint book as an inventory item that never gets in your way is rather clever. Oh, and I love the trivia book! Really tests your knowledge of the series! \n\nYou can clearly tell that this game is a labor of love. And the art style - love it or hate it - simply works when you see it in motion.\n\nEDIT 2: Have a drink whenever someone mentions \"The Secret of Monkey Island\". Now there's an idea for a party game that will get everyone drunk! :D",

      "Playerunknowns Battlegrounds\n\n\nIn my opinion hands down the best Battle Royale game released.\n\n\n+Built on a very flexible engine that is built to handle games of the FPS genre\n\n+Core mechanics of the game are solid and function with little to no bugs (In my experience, I've personally only encountered 2 bugs)\n\n+Vehicles that have good physics and good controls to them\n\n+The game in most aspects visually looks great\n\n+Plenty of weaponry (For release)\n\n+Gun mechanics themselves feel very solid and fluid, weapons have recoil to them and for me feel \"weighted\" \n\n+Nice animations for all weapons currently in game\n\n+The map size in my opinion is perfect. Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere \n\n++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for \"leaving you behind\" ) \n\n\n\n-Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) \n\n-Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter \"fix\" does NOT work for everyone) \n\n\nAside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. \n\n\n\nOverall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for them\n\n\n\n\nSystem specs the game was played on:\n\nIntel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghz\n\nNvidia GTX 960m 2GB \n\n16gb's DDR4 2133mhz\n\nWindows 10 \n\n(System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) \n\n\n\nEDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:\n\n\nNavigate to the game in your library\n\nRight click and go to properties, click \"Set Launch Options\" and enter the following command\n\n\n\n-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4",
      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",
      "Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.",
      "Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.",
      "Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup",
      "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",
      "I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess",
      "Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...",
      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.",
      "I have only one point of criticism:\nThis game lacks a proper ending or epilog; something like The Witcher's Blood & Wine DLC. After adventuring hundreds of hours, after growing fond of and close to my companions, I got kicked so hard out of the game - it hurt!\nIn fact I immediately started a 2nd playthrough, because I wasn't yet ready to let go. Please Larian, give us an epilog or at least one last night at the camp with all my allies, companions and friends for the Definitive Edition.\n\nedit: As of patch5 this has been implemented. Thanks Larian Studios! You guys are the best!",
      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",
      "This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.",
      "Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.",
      "I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.",
      "Great story, great features. But in my honest opinion unless your going for a nostalgia trip, give it a pass. The gun play and AI alone is enough for me to justify a refund, I mean shit cops hear the sounds of gunshots right next to them and act like nothing is happening. Immersion 0/10 sorry. I must admit I really enjoyed this game on console, but I am gonna have to take the money and run. Notice how almost all of the reviews just say All YOU haD to do Was FoLlow The DAmn Train cj or Ill HAve TWo NumBER 9s. I cant say I didn't expect this game to be a little shit judging by how old it is, but I will NOT suck it off and say buy it, the actual game play is PATHETIC. In all honesty I think this game remastered with gta v's physics and polish would be SOOO much better than gta v. They really captured the hood life in this one, damn shame it fucking sucks. This game's age sadly isn't up to par and sadly, it's getting a fat thumbs down from this boomer.",

      "After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",
      "Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.",
      "I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.",
      "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
      "[i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try. The reactions become pure instinct, flowing in a quick, relentless succession of moving, shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles. But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead. A punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell, mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next. This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year. Absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes.",

      "This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

      "The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.",
      "Something I've been needing to get off my chest, despite how much maxis and EA go on about how much they care for the LGBTQ community, it's clear to me that they don't. First if they did they wouldn't be pushing the community the whey and as hard as they have. When things get pushed like they are, hateful people just harden there harts more, and just become infuriated. The sympathetic the become hatful towards it. The more something gets pushed, after awhile the more it gets hatted. A better approach would be, (if they really did care,) would be to put what they are talking about into a FREE pack, and get people whom make amazing custom content to contribute to it. If there is enough nice stuff in the pack people will download it, and talk people whom are on the fence to download it, and maybe to come over, and might start to get the people on the other side to at least get on the fence. That whey the LGBTQ community would get there representation, and acceptance would be pushed in a whey that won't burn people out.\n\n\nAnother resin why they should do it like this, and is part of why people are getting mad, is that they bought this game a certain whey, paid a lot for it and it's DLC, now they are changing, it and braking it to do so. Changing the experience against there will. Evan something you love like chocolate, or bacon, or anything will become something you hate if it's shoved down your throat ageist you will. If you want people to take it just offer it, most of the time people will take it. And if they don't just make it just make it more appealing. IE instead of braking the main game to add something even the LGBTQ community can't enjoy with a broken game. Make a free pack, and to tempt more people to get the pack, just add more nice CAS and build mode stuff. And maybe update the pack and add more stuff to it every once in awhile.\n\n\nI just had to say this for two resins, one companies being this careless or ignorant is just killing the public sentiment for LGBTQ and similar groups. And two, they are just killing interest in what they are selling, it will cut the Sims 4's life short, and will cut the Sims 5's life much, much sorter. \nIt's good to give options, as long as they are options. Or you are just like Hennery Ford, “The people can have the model T in any color! so long as it's black.”\n",

      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety.

      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",

      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",

It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]",

It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1.

You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",
      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",
      "Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy.

      "$15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",
      "I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.",

      "[u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]",
      "[h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!",
      "I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",
      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",
      "It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me.

      "This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n",

      "This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.",
      "Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.",
      "This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.",
      "Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.",
      "d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.",
      "First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.",
      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...",
      "Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",
      "This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!",
      "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.",

      "The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.",

      "I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. \n\nHomeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. \n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. \n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.",
      "Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.",

      "So this is a fairly new pixel horror adventure game that I am indeed looking forward to, and i must say it is really good and its worth checking out. \n\nWell since the prologue is very short and sweet i won't spoil the story, there seems to be a super mysterious vibe to it. I just loved how polished the artwork is. Its a fairly new modernized pixel game and you can tell that instantly. Loved the alternative endings so far, strong occult and supernatural vibes, but i didnt feel that much scared playing the prologue except reading the ritual instructions. Not only there are alternative endings but alternative actions too which is quite unexpected, so the game is heading on the right direction. \n\nThis game is worth being voice acted, it's super great and the CG character art isnt bad either. Characterization of the main protagonist is pretty good of what i saw, she is a skeptic and this is a horror game, so far so good. To the devs, all i can say is that the game is going in the right direction and I am expecting more interesting things. \n\nCant wait for the full version to come out!!",
      "Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).",
      "I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.",
      "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
      "This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)",
      "Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.",
      "Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended",
      "Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.",
      "I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.",
      "ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team",
      "Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.",
      "It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.",
      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",
      "i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings",
      "It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails.

      "I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",
      "You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n",
      "This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.",
      "Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.",

I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.",
      "[h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.",
      "I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.",
      "Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.",
      "[h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.",
      "So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).",
      "My first console was an Atari 400 so, I may be a bit partial and nostalgic.\nHowever. its not like I haven't played these games in forty years.\nThis is a truly amazing release that I hope other developers follow.\nIt's a documentary, a museum, and a games collection. They meld into brilliance. This is well worth the price of admission. You get documentary segments interwoven with artifacts, internal documents AND THE GAMES.\nDid you just watch a segment, read the internal documents from development? Yeah? Why not give the game a quick go!?!\nTons of games spanning the beginning arcade to the Jaguar, with all the tasty history thrown in.",
      "I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.",
      "In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.",
      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.",
      "This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage.

      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.",
      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",
      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",

      "I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.",
      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",
      "Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]",
      "Deathloop is definitely not your average video game.\n\nYou'll either love it or hate it.\n\nThe first few hours are the weakest. You, as a new player, don't know what to do, what's important and you never keep what you find. Only after completing several mission objectives you get the ability to collect residuum and actually infuse your found items for later use in later loops or after you die. That's why it's always better to just go straight to the objectives and not explore the map at all, otherwise it's just gonna be a big time waste.\n\nAfter you acquire the ability to make permanent items (character and weapon trinkets) which you'll be able to use in future runs and collect some crucial weapons (like silent gun) and abilities ([in-game slabs] like Shift that allows you to teleport short distances) - then the game fully opens up. \n\nReal fun begins after you learn all maps and shortcuts and how to toy with your enemies (but it takes quite a lot of time to get there).\n\nStealth is very easy, the enemy AI is dumb at best. The more trinkets and slabs you get - the more variety in gameplay opens up. \n\nAction is very smooth, Abilities are strong and versatile, that's where this game shines to be honest. \n\nThere are 4 different areas and all of them change depending of the time of the day (morning, noon, afternoon and evening). Depending of the time of the day - some areas become accessible, some become closed, The enemies and items also change their locations and sometimes you'll be able to encounter bosses (in-game they are called visionaries). They are not hard to kill, but it's quite hard to get to them. That's the fun part of this whole game. The more you replay all areas, the more information you'll acquire about visionaries and their behaviour. It's possible to deal with them all without killing a single other enemy.\n\nBut with all that comes the not so fun part - exploration and doing the same thing over and over and over again. It's gonna be hard at first, every area is very detailed and it's really easy to miss a code written on a desk or a wall, A lot of sniffing around is required for clues and multiple times per map. It definitely makes repetition your new best friend.\n\nThere are a lot of puzzles and challenges. If you are not shooting dumb NPCs - you're definitely trying to crack a solution to a puzzle. Sometimes you'll need to visit several maps on the exact time of day at which events occur and find the exact required item or piece of information in order to solve a puzzle. Yeah. It's a big hassle, but that's how this game is and how it functions. If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy Deathloop. But be prepared to use a guide or two for some of them and a lot of patience.\n\nDuring some objectives it's very easy to make mistakes and fail. Several challenges require you to be pixel perfect in execution. Didn't notice that mine placed on a generator? Too bad, you'll gonna have to restart or try in another loop.\n\nI disliked that once you find a new weapon, you have to take it with you and drop one of your 3 weapons. You will never be able to use the dropped one for the rest of the loop. Considering that you'll always find a new toy to play with - your loadout will always be half-baked. It's actually extremely annoying, the same can be said about your slab abilities too (only after you find them all, then the ability upgrades will go straight into your inventory after finishing a level).\n\nAnd of course, there is Julianna. She is your \"buddy\" the whole game and she talks to you at the start of every level and well... she is always trying to kill you. It's fun when she invades and disrupts your chill Groundhogday experience. You can even let other real players invade you as Julianna. Fun, if you like to fill yourself with some adrenaline. Either you kill her, or she kills you and you'll have to start over the whole loop ^^\n\nFunny, but Colt reminded me of Draymond Green from Golden State Warriors. In some instances he looks exactly like him haha.\n\nThere are some AI bugs and the game starts to stutter the longer you play. Kinda strage, but it was for me. Occasionally framerates can go from smooth to choppy quite fast.\n\nDeathloop is a decent game overall. Idea is good, but works much better in movies, because there you don't have to sit through the same routines every single time and you get to the next big reveal a lot quicker. \n\nI think Julianna was a bit underused. Imagine how awesome this game could be if Deahtloop worked similar to The Lost Vikings where you control 3 characters at the same time. She could have had different abilities, different strengths. A duo trying to break the loop! Pretty cool, eh? Anyway, That's just my 2 cents.",
      "What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.",
      "Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).",
      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",
      "This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping.

      "I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game.

      "Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!",
      "Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.",
      "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",
      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "All I have to say, is 1 word. Wow. \n\nThis game is just us kids back in the early to mid 90's playing Chorno Trigger all over again. But instead being kids, we transformed to \"boring\" adults. \n\nAnd one of those kids, wanted another Chrono Trigger 2, but the big adults said \"NO!\" So one the kids, promised to everyone, one day, they will make another game just like CT, and everyone will be happy with joy. \n\nFast forward to 2023, and the dream is indeed real. \n\nThis game screams nostalgia for those fans. Nothing but amazing from what I've played from the demo. \n\nThe game also has this this subtle love for Lunar Silver Star Story. With the love of exploring /adventures. \n\nWhich is alone makes me fan. \n\nThe gameplay is just so rich, and very fun. You can't just sit there and press 1 button to attack. No. You have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus, and do some combos. Neat idea to stay on your 2 feet. \n\nThe music really good. Capture the world you're playing. \n\nTo every team who worked on this game, just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy. \n\n5 stars from what I've played, and if you're a fan of old school JRPG, then you owe to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry. \n\n\n\nHopefully Top 5 games this year for me? \n\nSea Of Stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself. \n\nBig Thumbs Up indeed!",
      "This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!",

      "Read all the 10 negative reviews for the game, and not a single positive review is present. All the reviews are fairly accurate to what the game presents to its players.

No comment on the goal, as it is either self-explanatory, or the audio and Sound effects, as it was nothing note-worthy.\n\nIn short, not a single pro is evident in this game, or in my experience during playing.

      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",

      "In life, failure is as inevitable as success – this is the underlying principle of great puzzle games. You're equipped with all the tools you need to succeed and it's your responsibility to utilize them effectively to achieve the goals set before you.\n\nHUMANITY places you in control of a luminous Shiba Inu, tasked with guiding hordes of people towards a light that transports them into the unknown. The game unfolds like a series of puzzle boxes, each with a fundamental set of rules: shepherd your humans to the light, prevent them from falling from great heights, and use the provided tools to avert their untimely demise. If navigating the crowds from point A to point B wasn't challenging enough, the game rewards your efforts to collect Goldys – the epitome of human accomplishment – which in turn unlock progress and assistive tools for easier puzzle-solving.\n\nInitially, the toolset is simple, with arrows for direction and commands to jump. These rudimentary tools soon amalgamate into a complex web of commands, making the gameplay increasingly intricate. It would be easy to liken HUMANITY to Lemmings, but doing so would disregard the platform challenges that uniquely define this game. As a player, you'll find yourself questioning how to access certain areas of a level to place commands and realizing that the stream of people you're guiding are also instrumental in your own journey.\n\nThe tranquil aesthetics of HUMANITY are a signature of the team behind Tetris Effect, Child of Eden, Lumines, and REZ. Coupled with the pseudo-futuristic techno music, these visuals create an immersive and cohesive experience, reminiscent of an interactive design studio’s portfolio. The game's sleek aesthetics provide a calming backdrop for the perplexing trials that await you.\n\nThe crafting of a good puzzle game demands talented designers capable of devising some of the most challenging levels. HUMANITY embraces this notion by enabling anyone to create and share their levels, ensuring a constant influx of new challenges from the community.\n\nFans of games like Portal, Baba is You, The Witness, or The Talos Principle will find HUMANITY an easy recommendation. As with those games, failure is not a dead end; instead, it forms part of the learning process propelling you towards success.\n\nHUMANITY is a true Goldy of puzzle games. Underneath its engaging gameplay, it communicates a deeper message – one that resonates with its players, and, much like its puzzles, equips you with enough tools to reach your own conclusions.\n",

      "good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n",
      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",

The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies.

      "Holy fuck. I wish I could recommend this game. I really, really wish I could. But there's just so much frustration with the core experience that kills me, to the point that I cannot see myself going through to the end.\n\nOkay. The graphics, story, music, world design and even some of the small design features are incredible. I don't need to tell anyone that. I love Studio Ghibli, and as a fellow composer, Joe Hisaishi's music. However, the core aspect you probably noticed I left out is the gameplay. Yeah.\n\nThe amount of grind in this game feels unreal, which as a JRPG I wouldn't care about, but the combat system is so utterly meaningless. I saw a review that said something to the effect of - the game works on \"if you find a difficult section, you can't outsmart it, just have to grind until it's not difficult anymore\" and that is the most accurate sentence I've heard about any game. A third of my playtime is grind. The sacrifice of static turn-based combat is the game has a major lack of input from the player, but also a lack of responsiveness when the player actually needs to make quick and smart decisions. For reference, I got up to when the game gives you a dragon and essentially sets you off on a quest for 3 magic macguffin items, where it should open up, but that's when the majority of grind kick in.\n\nImagine you were playing Pokemon, but every evolution resets your level. No hyperbole, it resets the level to 1, and you have to grind it up all again, spending about an hour to get back the stats you lost, which itself is dependant on the evolution actually being worth it (it usually isn't). Not only that. but all the Pokemon you catch also only come at level 1. That is this game. What I find incredibly difficult about this is you have to willingly handicap yourself to progress for an hour, and if you try to evolve your familiars in bulk, you end up with a useless party. This whole system of catching creatures they directly took from Pokemon, meaning they saw how leveling up worked and thought this needed to be changed. It was a very deliberate design decision. Not to mention you often get multiple evolution paths that drastically change play-styles with little to no indicator to what you're actually choosing from.\n\nAs a kid, this game would be too complex with too many systems and options to handle at once. As an adult, I don't have the time to pour hours into a game that so frequently disrespects your time. If this game wasn't animated by Studio Ghibli, it would've been forgotten about quickly. Change my mind.",
      "It's a really fun game, it looks and sounds great, and the new mechanics are fun.\n\nBut there are some bugs that I ran into the day that it launched 4 months ago, here's a link to the steam discussion:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/365660/discussions/0/535152511382137328/\nIf you prefer to use a keyboard they most likely will ruin your run at some point.\n\nI still like the game but buying anything with permanent bugs is never fun.

      "I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.",
      "Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.",
      "This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",
      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it’s developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it’s even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. \n\nAt its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game’s complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. \n\nOut of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3’s two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I’m stuck on one mission that I simply can’t seem to complete.)\n\nHowever the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.\n\nOh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I’m sure there are so many others that I haven’t even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.\n\nIn wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  \n\nPurchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later. \n\n(IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)",
      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "User agreements are so scummy, I read them and I would sooner pirate this game than play it for free. IM GOING TO DO SOMETHING I CANNOT UNDO IF THIS SHIT DOENST STOP SOON.",
      "I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.",
      "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "There's a lot to like about Control, and I'm glad I played it. It's unfortunate how often I found myself thinking, \"they shouldn't have bothered\". The environments and level design are quite good, and I liked poking around and finding lore. I can't avoid mentioning the destruction physics and graphics, which were beautiful, impressive, and made me feel like I was actually destroying the world around me. The story and characterization are decent, with par for the course voice acting for a video game. The game is a fine length with plenty of levels and missions. Overall, Control is a solid game that's worth trying.\n\nThe gunplay is another story. While levitating, dashing, launching, seizing, shielding, and the other combat powers you have at your disposal felt effective and even enjoyable at times (especially launch), the guns never felt right in any of their incarnations. The visual effects of the service weapons as they shapeshift are a nice touch, though many of them feel either inaccurate or unable to rise to the task, damage-wise. For magic guns they felt very much like something was missing, and could have used some more work. For a game with so much of its duration devoted to combat, it doesn't feel like gunplay got its fair share.\n\nWith such anemic gunplay, I was surprised to see a skill tree, crafting, and randomized mods complete with a rarity system. This is where \"they shouldn't have bothered\" comes in. The skill tree is utterly boring, being mostly +X% to a stat with the occasional ability upgrade that could have been a quest reward. With an expensive reset cost and the fact that you'll be able to nearly max out everything, the skill tree doesn't exactly play into buildcrafting. Then again, neither do the mods. \n\nWhen I say \"randomized mods\", I mean in the style of an MMO. Each mod has a random stat and then a random buff to that stat within a range, depending on its rarity. These things are everywhere, trip over a box and you'll find three. I feel that this system makes little sense for this game. Especially with the DLC mods, there are so many different effects that you'll find it difficult to create a specific \"build\" and will probably stick to the core stats like damage, hp, energy, etc. It's a thin veneer of progression that wouldn't be out of place in a multiplayer game, RPG, or MMO.\n\nSo say you want to engage with the mod system and flesh out a \"build\". Well, the jukebox has you covered. After you've farmed up or crafted some coins (tickets), you can pay to enter a repeatable mission and earn some random mods. This is the exact same mission every time you play it. It's not even changed procedurally or set in different areas of the game. It's the exact same level, the same objectives, the same enemies, the same boss, etc., every single time you play it. This mission is designed to be farmed. It's not the only farming you're encouraged to do, either. What's worse, as you play, your tiny inventory quickly fills up and you'll find yourself stopping after each mission (or in the middle of a mission) to do inventory management. Compare mods, equip mods, delete mods, farm mods, fill up your inventory... it's not an engaging system. They simply shouldn't have bothered.\n\nControl is at its best when it's being a single player game, with environments and worldbuilding that suck you in, with exploration and lore, and with the missions and duties of being the director. Control is at its worst when it thinks it's a multiplayer game, with boring skill trees, mods, crafting, and inventory management. It's so needless and mars what would otherwise be a perfectly serviceable game (save the service weapons).",
      "I'm severely disappointed whenever a game points at the stands and intends to hit a home run, and then instead smashes the pitcher out after the bat flies out of their hands.\n\nIt looks wonderful, it's relentlessly and uncompromisingly unique, and it plays like complete hell.\n\nUnreasonable difficulty, bordering on sadism, a unique idea let down by just-so-imprecise hitboxes and the feeling of being far too weak to take on anything.\n\nI haven't enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone else, if you buy it and find favour with it then bully for you, but I'll never understand how.",
      "You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.",

      "A fantastic rogue-lite where dying doesn't mean a hard reset. In death your character is succeeded by one of their offspring and all of your earned skills, talents, equipment and gold are passed down from one generation to the next, ensuring that even the weakest of players can still make progress. After each death you are given the choice of three characters that are randomised from a pool of three to eight classes (depending on how many you unlock) who are given randomly drawn traits and abilites; some good, some bad. The castle itself is also randomised keeping the game fresh despite there only being four environments.\n\nAll in all, I found it a thoroughly addictive game despite minimal experience in the genre beforehand and would recommend it to anyone who merely thought \"that looks interesting\" as they skimmed over the Steam store page.",
      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",
      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",
      "Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",
      "unprofessional review:\n\nits a really deep lore kind of game, very cool!\nit has some horror and grinding elements which i always love\ni havent finished the game just yet tho \nthe visuals are very cute\nas soon as i bought it was hooked!\noke theres many more but im to lazy to type :joy:\n\nover all ill give it a 10/10\nvery interesting lore wise",
      "As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.",
      "Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.\n\nFirst of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.\n\nOther than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.\n\nI would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.\n\nIf you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.",
      "Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.",
      "I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.",
      "I genuinely had no expectations with Odyssey. Assassins Creed died along with Desmond for me. However, I was truly blown away with positivity for this installment of the series. Odyssey reminds me and takes a page from the Witcher 3. It's incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion more superior and engaging than Origins. That said, I couldn't get into Origins it wasn't for me.\n\nI've been a Assassins Creed fan ever since the first game. Over the years the game has evolved, adapted, and improved on every aspect up to Black Flag. I didn't feel the need to play the future installments after Black Flag. In my opinion they didn't fit in the mold of the series and I didn't support the actions Ubisoft were taking with the title. Odyssey changed my perspective on that with its fresh ideas and made me believe that a different direction isn't a bad one.\n\nI still miss my boy Ezio :(",
      "As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.",
      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea."

But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- #BringBackKI\n\n[list]\n    [*]Rollback netcode\n    [*]Large roster of 29 characters\n    [*]Unique characters\n    [*]Great tutorial\n    [*] Free form combo system\n    [*] Tons of single player content\n    [*] Fairly easy controls and execution for beginners\n    [*] Tons of mindgames and the possibility of breaking out of combos\n    [*] Best Fighting game resource ever [url=https://ki.infil.net/index.html]Complete Killer Instinct Guide[/url]\n[/list]\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game\n- This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- i regret buying this on sale\nthis deserved full price\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize. Greeted by a traffic light, you tried to remember what was happening. It turns out that you have a unique ability: reading an object's memory. As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!\n- I just finished Metro 2033 Redux a while ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best things is that the game is COMPLETELY in a first person perspective, including the cutscenes. Reminded me of Bioshock Infinite a bit in that respect. You are fully immersed in your world. Except for the ending though..for some reason they chose to do a zoomed out pre-rendered cutscene there. \n\nI played on Survival mode (normal difficulty) and the challenge was decent. At one or two points in the game, it wasn't clear to me what to do (probably wasn't paying attention to the dialogues), but I like the no-hand-holding thing. At the last level as well, I ended up running out of filters (pretty sure I scoured all around for supplies and hit the limit many times) so that kinda took away from the experience a bit. \n\nBut otherwise, the story was good. Decent enemy variation. Stealth is possible against humans as well (game doesn't explicitly tell you this IIRC). Just make sure you crouch all the time and turn off your flashlight!\n\nCombat was great as well. The weapon handling felt really good. I found a quad-barrel shotgun and that was massive. Killed all Watchmen in a single shot! \n\nAtmosphere was realistic and well done. Performance was great as well on my humble GTX 750 (with medium settings). \n\nIt's hard for me to find fault with the game. I went in with little expectation, but then again I also don't play much FPS games. This is definitely better gameplay wise than Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line though.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- How is this game so damned good?\nAnd for 3 bucks.\n\nVampire Survivors is setting a new bar for value in gaming. $70 for a new AAA game? Pfft. I think not. Not when games like Vampire Survivors are available.\n\nIt is fully functional on the Steam Deck.\n\nThis is an RPG Auto-battler enemy hell (bullet hell). You control the progression and pathing of your character, the game handles the actual combat, making for a near perfect synergy between game and gamer.\n\nThere are currently four main maps and then a bunch of specialty maps, one of which was almost definitely designed specifically to help you expedite your unlocks. Each has its own unique theme.\n\nUnlocks are the progression system in this one, and it works. Accomplishing almost any unique task or reaching certain levels will unlock the next things in line. However, character unlocks have an additional cost in gold (acquired in game). Similarly, permanent character boosts can be unlocked and all characters receive the benefits of all unlocks. There are even more things to unlock veyond those, and everything not only feels practical, but have a noticeable affect on gameplay.\n\nYou'd think that it being an enemy (read: bullet) hell, and with an array of abilities at your disposal, the screen would fill up quickly, and it does, but somehow, the devs managed to make your avatar noticeable and trackable no matter how high the screen chaos gets.\n\nSpeaking of which, for lofi graphics, these are just flat out cool. Again, it just works. The soundtrack mirrors this, and you'll be able to switch between tracks as you please. Additionally, I find this is a great game to play while jamming your own tunes.\n\nIn my opinion, the value at 3 bucks and the huge amount of gameplay variety make this a no brainer. You get far less from any number of full priced AAA titles. AND...the game hasn't even concluded development yet. What other surprises do the devs have in store, I wonder?\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- 9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\n- BE ADVISED!!!\nif u are from asia, just don't buy it! there is no server for us.\nwe can't found any server even from EU & NA\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- All I have to say, is 1 word. Wow. \n\nThis game is just us kids back in the early to mid 90's playing Chorno Trigger all over again. But instead being kids, we transformed to \"boring\" adults. \n\nAnd one of those kids, wanted another Chrono Trigger 2, but the big adults said \"NO!\" So one the kids, promised to everyone, one day, they will make another game just like CT, and everyone will be happy with joy. \n\nFast forward to 2023, and the dream is indeed real. \n\nThis game screams nostalgia for those fans. Nothing but amazing from what I've played from the demo. \n\nThe game also has this this subtle love for Lunar Silver Star Story. With the love of exploring /adventures. \n\nWhich is alone makes me fan. \n\nThe gameplay is just so rich, and very fun. You can't just sit there and press 1 button to attack. No. You have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus, and do some combos. Neat idea to stay on your 2 feet. \n\nThe music really good. Capture the world you're playing. \n\nTo every team who worked on this game, just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy. \n\n5 stars from what I've played, and if you're a fan of old school JRPG, then you owe to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry. \n\n\n\nHopefully Top 5 games this year for me? \n\nSea Of Stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself. \n\nBig Thumbs Up indeed!\n- [h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on. Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n...

Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10\n- Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.\n- [h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n- [h1]THIS GAME HAS COMMUNITY SERVERS WITHOUT HACKERS.[/h1]\n\nI've been seeing a lot of reviews talking about this game being [i]\"infested with hackers, can't go a single game without hackers, hackers ruining everything\"[/i] etc. but I have yet to see a single hacker in any of my games because I play in community servers. I actually put off going back to this game for the longest time because of these reviews and thought there were only official servers, but I was completely wrong, [b]THERE ARE STILL ACTIVE COMMUNITY SERVERS WITH ADMINS ACTIVELY MONITORING FOR HACKERS.[/b]\n\nI genuinely don't understand why nobody is mentioning the fact that there are community servers, literally none of the top reviews say so. The only reason I didn't go back to this game any sooner was because of this one misconception, but to reiterate, [b]THERE ARE COMMUNITY SERVERS,[/b] just like Battlefield 4, which is the primary reason why BF4 is still alive to this day.\n\n[u]Completely ditch the matchmaking/official servers and just use the server browser,[/u] [b]I HAVE YET TO RUN INTO A SINGLE HACKER BECAUSE OF THIS.[/b] Anyone leaving a negative review because of \"hackers\" are probably still playing on official servers and are most likely just garbage at the game. [b]It's very easy to be really good at this game lmao.[/b]\n\n[u]The game is still very much alive and well without hackers[/u] and is one of the most fun/immersive FPS games ever made.\n\nEdit: I've played this game since launch on Origin and easily have over 200 hours, I only just this week started playing again on Steam for convenience, since low hours matters to some people lol.\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- [h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- No better CO-OP Experience, even decent solo, just remember the golden CO-OP rules:\n-Never push buttons without the whole team green lighting\n-Always Rock and Stone back\n-Never steal another dwarves drink. \n-Dont double dip Resupply pods without asking\n\n\nIf you choose to accept a contract with Deep Rock Galactic, good luck brother, see you in the caves.\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.\n- Climbed some rocks\nClimbed hot rocks\nClimbed cave rocks\nClimbed windy rocks\nClimbed snowy rocks\nHad an existential crisis\n\nIn conclusion, good game\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n- My favorite part of history was when Ghandi built the Great wall in 4000 BC for his Jewish army.\n10/10, helped me with history class.\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- This game got criminally low attention.\nThis is basically Risk Of Rain, but Top Down, less budget and same amount of fun.\nI've played just a bit before writing this, and yes, I can already see some flaws in the game, yet it definitely is worth of your attention. Especially with the sale price.\nWill update the review after investing more hours into it\n\n【グループB】\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- This game should have easily swept the game awards for art and theme.  \nthe mechanics, music, visuals, and story blend together flawlessly to communicate the experience of bitter ruin and abrupt descent into calamity.  The gameplay loop is pretty standard for a party based RPG.  Prepare, Enter the dungeon, kill the monster, loot, gain power, then do it again in a tougher dungeon.  The sanity system, very good writing and voice acting personalize the experience and keep you locked in your gaming chair anxious to delve deeper into just how bad things really are.\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- \"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard\n- First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- [u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]\n- [h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!\n- This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n\n- The best war strategy game,, \nI hope in the future they make the similar game (COH3)\nwith modern armies and tanks and modern equipment..\nThey can make USA, British, German, France in one side,,\nand make Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey in another side.\n\nCOH2 Rating Analysis:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGunfires and Explosion: 8/10\nDynamic Weather Effect: 9/10\nAI: 9/10\nUnits and Vehicles: 7/10\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years.

Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n... Now I have to start over in Argentina. It's fine, Argentina is nice, it means I can tell you about the excellent track designs, which I'm fairly sure much like Dirt Rally, have been taken from real world locations and are distilled down versions of their real lif-\n\n\"Unable to connect to racenet. MyTeam is Unavailable.\"\n\n...\n\nYou know what? None of what I say is going to matter. Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- i regret buying this on sale\nthis deserved full price\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. \n\nHomeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. \n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. \n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- I called Grandma a bitch. Grandma immediately murdered me. 10/10 would die again.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- So this is a fairly new pixel horror adventure game that I am indeed looking forward to, and i must say it is really good and its worth checking out. \n\nWell since the prologue is very short and sweet i won't spoil the story, there seems to be a super mysterious vibe to it. I just loved how polished the artwork is. Its a fairly new modernized pixel game and you can tell that instantly. Loved the alternative endings so far, strong occult and supernatural vibes, but i didnt feel that much scared playing the prologue except reading the ritual instructions. Not only there are alternative endings but alternative actions too which is quite unexpected, so the game is heading on the right direction. \n\nThis game is worth being voice acted, it's super great and the CG character art isnt bad either. Characterization of the main protagonist is pretty good of what i saw, she is a skeptic and this is a horror game, so far so good. To the devs, all i can say is that the game is going in the right direction and I am expecting more interesting things. \n\nCant wait for the full version to come out!!\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- [h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.\n- I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.\n- Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- My first console was an Atari 400 so, I may be a bit partial and nostalgic.\nHowever. its not like I haven't played these games in forty years.\nThis is a truly amazing release that I hope other developers follow.\nIt's a documentary, a museum, and a games collection. They meld into brilliance. This is well worth the price of admission. You get documentary segments interwoven with artifacts, internal documents AND THE GAMES.\nDid you just watch a segment, read the internal documents from development? Yeah? Why not give the game a quick go!?!\nTons of games spanning the beginning arcade to the Jaguar, with all the tasty history thrown in.\n- I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.\n- In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage. I hope the devs on this fall down a short but non lethal flight of concrete stairs that will make them go through as much therapy as i have wasted time on this game\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)\n- #BringBackKI\n\n[list]\n    [*]Rollback netcode\n    [*]Large roster of 29 characters\n    [*]Unique characters\n    [*]Great tutorial\n    [*] Free form combo system\n    [*] Tons of single player content\n    [*] Fairly easy controls and execution for beginners\n    [*] Tons of mindgames and the possibility of breaking out of combos\n    [*] Best Fighting game resource ever [url=https://ki.infil.net/index.html]Complete Killer Instinct Guide[/url]\n[/list]\n- Definitely not addictive.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- AAA Industry: NOOOOOO!!! You can’t have a high quality and feature complete campaign with only a 6.5 GB install made by one guy using Unity, it has to be 200+ GB made by 5 studios and it needs to be an unfinished 3 hour mediocrity and gouge the consumers $70 USD for it!\n\nThis game: [b]HAHA LEG CHAINSAW GO BRRRR[/b]\n- Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game\n- This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once. This game is pure feeling.\n\n\nthat aside, this game is pretty much a perfect game for me, the story is really interesting, the music is beautiful and the art is gorgeous, and the characters and the atmosphere are so fucking believable i think i know everybody in this game, or atleast i feel so.\n\nAs a small town dude i really relate with a lot of thing in this game.\n\nThis game is special, its special for me.\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- this game is fire\n\nedit: actual review\n\na few weeks ago, i picked up dicey dungeons and that was a lot of fun; my first introduction to dice games\n\nafterwards, i saw some streamers playing slice and dice so i picked that up, and that was fun too - just not on steam unfortunately\n\nwell, this game is slay the spire + dice + cards. but what really sets it apart is the whole tug of war between corruption and purification. each character is very unique and i really can't recommend this enough, even with only just a few hours played.\n\ni just beat the game on difficulty 0 with the first character after playing the first 5 a few times.\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- i regret buying this on sale\nthis deserved full price\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- No matter what the reviews say, this game is pretty excellent.\nGameplay wise its pretty good, the match 3 systems are fun and almost exciting to play at times.\nTheres no sex, which isn't a bad thing as if thats what you're looking for just search for it online lol\nThe stories are good and the designs are pretty, sure it's short but it fits the pricepoint.\n\nThe developers have announced that they've gone bankrupt which is a shame but what can you do.\n\nOverall 8/10\n- [h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means. [b]Wait it out.[/b][/list][/list]\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- Pros:\n> Decent selection of interior desing elements\n> Uncommon but interesting gameplay idea if you're into interior design and building\n> Fair price for amount of activities you get in base game\n> Gameplay leght\n> Regural updates\n\nCons:\n> You can't change location of windows in the house - some are placed in awkward places thus creating decent rooms becomes difficult\n> Game optimisation is questionable for such graphics  -  with RX vega 56 I barely get 60 fps \n> No replayability on same save file - once you sell property you cannot do it again\n> Once property is sold there's only some screenshots but no actual way to look around again\n> No steam workshop or mods\n\nIdeas for possible future updates:\n> Add floor plan design feature - building and demolishing walls 10 times is frustrating\n> Add ability to build custom houses and change locations of windows\n> Add ability to enter sold properties\n> Increase game performance\n\nDLCs:\n> HGTV DLC adds moderate amount of additional jobs\n> Garden DLC adds alot of activities outside the house but is a bit buggy. In my opinion some features should be in base game\n- Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.\n- Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.\n- I've read some of the negative reviews and name calling is petty so instead I'll just say a lot of those opinions are dumb.\n\nLook. This isn't Firewatch. This is a seven year old game that pissed off a lot of bros and continues (apparently, christ) to do so because it embraced not only being a walking simulator but a gay one at that. And yeah bro, 15 bucks seems steep for a game that you can finish in under an hour, but hell, maybe don't speed run? It's a walking simulator after all. Or maybe support indie game devs. *Or maybe* read the Steam tags that say \"short\" and \"walking simulator\" and then don't count that against the game. You don't review CS;GO and say \"not bad, but too much shooting\" right? RIGHT? \n\nLook. I've had some wine. And I've had some feelings. And Gone Home is a piece of video game history whether people want it to be or not. It's a game I wish I would have known about when it was first released. Hell I needed it five years earlier than that. \n\nIf you're pissed that Gone Home wasn't dramatic enough or that it's \"homosexual\" then maybe realize that this game wasn't made for you and that does not qualify it as bad. \n\nAnyway, that cat journal achievement was neat.\n- [b]My playtime:[/b] 14.5h (based on Steam, 100% achievement)\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (1+ achievement).\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (33 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou wake up in a place you don't recognize.

As unreal as it sounds, [b]UNREAL LIFE[/b] tries to help you make sense of everything through a series of adventures and events.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Multiple endings, with variations of bad endings and one true ending\n- Cleverly-executed puzzles\n- Subtle hints in case you're stuck\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Unable to skip cutscenes\n- People who have trouble with flashing lights can't fully experience the game\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play atmospheric games, buy this at a sale. People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!\n- I just finished Metro 2033 Redux a while ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best things is that the game is COMPLETELY in a first person perspective, including the cutscenes. Reminded me of Bioshock Infinite a bit in that respect. You are fully immersed in your world. Except for the ending though..for some reason they chose to do a zoomed out pre-rendered cutscene there. \n\nI played on Survival mode (normal difficulty) and the challenge was decent. At one or two points in the game, it wasn't clear to me what to do (probably wasn't paying attention to the dialogues), but I like the no-hand-holding thing. At the last level as well, I ended up running out of filters (pretty sure I scoured all around for supplies and hit the limit many times) so that kinda took away from the experience a bit. \n\nBut otherwise, the story was good. Decent enemy variation. Stealth is possible against humans as well (game doesn't explicitly tell you this IIRC). Just make sure you crouch all the time and turn off your flashlight!\n\nCombat was great as well. The weapon handling felt really good. I found a quad-barrel shotgun and that was massive. Killed all Watchmen in a single shot! \n\nAtmosphere was realistic and well done. Performance was great as well on my humble GTX 750 (with medium settings). \n\nIt's hard for me to find fault with the game. I went in with little expectation, but then again I also don't play much FPS games. This is definitely better gameplay wise than Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line though.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- As a current spec op who has seen conflict in China, North Korea and Dust II, it's clear to me this game is barely mil-sim YET much more than another arcade type shooter ala COD. Within the weapon systems selection, well I'd say its pretty sparse as are the clothing options but where this game shines is in the finite number of deaths one can suddenly have, somewhat similar to the amount of coronary artery blockages the average American can withstand before succumbing to a cheeto dust infused death ride to St. Michaels gate.\n\nGraphically it is fine, runs well on my beastly PC (which is to be expected given the salary i earn putting my life on the line daily), seems to have very few glitches/bugs.\n\nThe sounds are way off though and needs a revamp on what actually body dismemberment should actually be like.\n\nUltimately what makes this game worth it is the player based, often I find myself among enthusiastic Aussies calling me the roo rider and exclaiming how fast my fast twitch reflexes are.\n\n8.3/10\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.\n- Just finished it. Having trouble putting words together.\n\nI went on a road trip around the US last year, and on my way down the west coast was surprised by how many giant factories passed by, puffing smoke into the air. One even had Google reviews, where it became clear that the town residents who worked there posted good reviews, and everyone else wanted the factory gone.\n\nThose did not compare to the oil refineries in Louisiana, one of which I had to pull off of the highway to properly behold. Certainly I'd seen images of them, but in real life their scale is hard to believe. And they're so bright, both because of innumerable light bulbs and the infamous refinery flame spouts. Even going through the pictures I took while worried the refinery security was going to attack, the size of these things accurately portrayed in none of them. I'd already played the NORCO demo by this point, and had it in my mind throughout my time in the area. There was even an encounter with an old man working at a convenience store somewhere around 1-2am who asked me if I believed in God with a crazed look in his eye, something I would not know was reality foreshadowing this game until the past week.\n\nSo my impression here, forming as I type this, is as follows: \n\nThe surreal imagery and sublime writing in NORCO combine to seem more accurate to my brief experience in the places resembling the real life Norco than any photo or video I've seen.\n\nA lot more can be said about this game, but I'm currently trying to untie my thoughts. So maybe later. For now, just know that I'd thoroughly recommend this game.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- How is this game so damned good?\nAnd for 3 bucks.\n\nVampire Survivors is setting a new bar for value in gaming. $70 for a new AAA game? Pfft. I think not. Not when games like Vampire Survivors are available.\n\nIt is fully functional on the Steam Deck.\n\nThis is an RPG Auto-battler enemy hell (bullet hell). You control the progression and pathing of your character, the game handles the actual combat, making for a near perfect synergy between game and gamer.\n\nThere are currently four main maps and then a bunch of specialty maps, one of which was almost definitely designed specifically to help you expedite your unlocks. Each has its own unique theme.\n\nUnlocks are the progression system in this one, and it works. Accomplishing almost any unique task or reaching certain levels will unlock the next things in line. However, character unlocks have an additional cost in gold (acquired in game). Similarly, permanent character boosts can be unlocked and all characters receive the benefits of all unlocks. There are even more things to unlock veyond those, and everything not only feels practical, but have a noticeable affect on gameplay.\n\nYou'd think that it being an enemy (read: bullet) hell, and with an array of abilities at your disposal, the screen would fill up quickly, and it does, but somehow, the devs managed to make your avatar noticeable and trackable no matter how high the screen chaos gets.\n\nSpeaking of which, for lofi graphics, these are just flat out cool. Again, it just works. The soundtrack mirrors this, and you'll be able to switch between tracks as you please. Additionally, I find this is a great game to play while jamming your own tunes.\n\nIn my opinion, the value at 3 bucks and the huge amount of gameplay variety make this a no brainer. You get far less from any number of full priced AAA titles. AND...the game hasn't even concluded development yet. What other surprises do the devs have in store, I wonder?\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my Curator group, it would be appreciated. Cheers.\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/32549618/[/code]\n- When I say this game changed the way I thought about life, I mean it. And before you say this game isn't worth 44 dollars, you are wrong. I would pay more than double just for this once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWhile this game may look like a stupid bishoujo romance game, it is so much more. Don't let the weird artstyle or obnoxious eyes fool you, this game will make you laugh. cry, depressed, happy, and everything in between. It is so extensive, so great, that there are over 13 character routes and stories to play in this game, all of which are good (some are incredible) and have some of the best, most fleshed our characters I have seen. This game is about life, change, friends, love, and most importantly, family. Every route in this game has a connection to family. (Clannad is a close-enough translation of family in Irish)\n\nIn case it helps, I'm a grown man who had a rather negative outlook on life, and this game me cry buckets. If you ever have thought about getting married and having kids, this game will MAKE you want to have a family. The clever writing and how the protagonist, Okazaki, changes throughout his life is all done so well. It made me realize how much we complain about our lives, but we don't need much to be happy or be motivated. In case it helps again, my mom loves this game, she connects with it quite a bit. Yet again, nothing bad to say here, only to say that Key is incredible and I will be reading some of their other works like Little Busters and Kanon.\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- THERE IS ONLINE CO-OP with REMOTE PLAY!  Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!\n- 9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\n- BE ADVISED!!!\nif u are from asia, just don't buy it! there is no server for us.\nwe can't found any server even from EU & NA\n- The Award for the worst Cancer Game 2017 goes to: Friday the 13th! \nCongrats! *clapping Hands with bloody Babytears in my eyes*\nThis Game is a complete waste of Money. Don't buy it - don't even think of buying this crappy Master Piece.\nIt's not worth it, to be honest.\nI played it for almost 200 Hours. And it's awful. Never saw a Game with these bugs, with these massive salty Community. There exactly 0 Bugfixes, so many exploits, the horrible earbleeding intro, the Community that is pure Cancer, the horrible Graphic that looks like it's straight out of the Kindergarten and the huge amount of Bugs. Bugs are normal, but MAN there are Bugs everywhere! I mean, yeah the Hype was real, but now i wish i could refund this crap.\nNever had to dream about uninstalling a game before.\nI mean, the Devs. are just Human like you and me - but honestly - never saw someone who failed his job like this.\nJust do me a favor, don't buy it. It's not worth the Ragequits, the broken Keyboards, the Heartattacks and it's definitely not the Money worth!\nNever want to touch it again.\n\nAnd btw. thank you for killing the Sealmothers and making the babyseals crying bloody sad little Tears. </3\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- All I have to say, is 1 word. Wow. \n\nThis game is just us kids back in the early to mid 90's playing Chorno Trigger all over again. But instead being kids, we transformed to \"boring\" adults. \n\nAnd one of those kids, wanted another Chrono Trigger 2, but the big adults said \"NO!\" So one the kids, promised to everyone, one day, they will make another game just like CT, and everyone will be happy with joy. \n\nFast forward to 2023, and the dream is indeed real. \n\nThis game screams nostalgia for those fans. Nothing but amazing from what I've played from the demo. \n\nThe game also has this this subtle love for Lunar Silver Star Story. With the love of exploring /adventures. \n\nWhich is alone makes me fan. \n\nThe gameplay is just so rich, and very fun. You can't just sit there and press 1 button to attack. No. You have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus, and do some combos. Neat idea to stay on your 2 feet. \n\nThe music really good. Capture the world you're playing. \n\nTo every team who worked on this game, just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy. \n\n5 stars from what I've played, and if you're a fan of old school JRPG, then you owe to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry. \n\n\n\nHopefully Top 5 games this year for me? \n\nSea Of Stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself. \n\nBig Thumbs Up indeed!\n- [h1]\"Connecting to Racenet...\"[/H1]\n\nSo Dirt Rally 2.0, or for the sake of brevity D2 is brilliant, when you're tearing down the leafy gravel tracks of the US of A, or picking your way through boulder strewn horrors of Argentina (which frankly feel more in line with spintyres than an actual rally course, be prepared to spend a lot of time in first and second gear), or haring along the asphalt of Spain (a worthy successor to the somewhat technical and twiddly Germany) this game is *outsta-\n\n\"Connecting to racenet....\"\n\nHang on. Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n...

MyTeam is Unavailable.\"\n\n...\n\nYou know what? None of what I say is going to matter. Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- Anti-Consumer DLC Practices. Capcom pls.\n\nWith the brand new release of Rashid, we now know you cannot buy a single character outright, you have to buy packs of in-game currency. And the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs. \n\nRashid is going for 350 coins, the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for $5, so you have to pay $10 for 500c or $12 for 610c and have leftovers.\n\nTypical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game. Capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as Street Fighter. All this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices. \n\nCapcom knows exactly what they're doing with these pricing structures and it's super friggen scummy of them. \n\nHopefully by the time they add characters I really want to buy in a few years, things have changed. I went from looking forward to future DLC characters, to it being something I would never want to pay for and support because of this trash. \n\nSo, thank you (and eff you) very much Capcom. Please turn this nonsense around ASAP and let us buy single DLC characters outright with actual money.\n- We need a 60fps patch ASAP. Having 30fps content on PC in [current year] is not acceptable.\n\nOther than that the game is pretty solid! It looks great, it plays great, the story was good imo, the characters are interesting and the amount of solo content is decent.\n\nHowever, the gear system is not as elaborate as in Mk11 and the microtransations are NOT a welcome sight. Denuvo also has to go. If Harada agreed that the addition of Denuvo in Tekken 7 was a mistake, so should NetherRealm.\nI also don't like that 2 characters that are going to be in the Kombat Pass are already in the game (Ermac and Quan Chi). Just give us these characters and come up with other ones for the KP. This is super greedy and lazy.\nIt's even worse than Sektor and Cyrax in MK11, at least you didn't let us play them, period. this time you decide to not make them playable (even thought they work for the AI) AND sell them at a later date? That's awful.\n\nThe game is good but needs improvement and shouldn't ship with performance issues, 30fps content, microtransactions, Denuvo and greedy DLC tactics. I would put a \"meh\" review if I could because of the negatives but for that reason I have to say \"no\".\n- Damn, deeply devoted developer designed Death's Door.\nDiscover dungeons, divine drama, delightfully depicted Death [b]:D[/b]\nDark daw's daunting duels demand deft digits.\nDynamite deal definitely does deserve desire!\n- Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10\n- Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.\n- [h1]SDHQ STEAM DECK PERFORMANCE REVIEW:[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] Follow our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42495043/]curator[/url] page for more Steam Deck reviews and our [url=https://twitter.com/SteamDeckHQ]Twitter[/url] for immediate updates on all SDHQ content including reviews, news, and more!\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n\n\n[i]This review is based ONLY on performance of the game on the STEAM DECK.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]The Game Itself:[/h1]\n\n\nChained Echoes is a 16-bit era inspired JRPG which sees you travel across the varied, war-stricken continent of Valandis to bring an end to the war between the 3 kingdoms. With a world filled with charming characters, vicious foes, and bakers that use wood as an ingredient, you will fight in turn-based combat utilizing a complex equipment and skill system to fend for yourself. Chained Echoes also features a customizable airship, tons of items to loot and craft, a 30-40 hour playtime, no random encounters, and a fantastic soundtrack inspired by the PSX era. Will you be able to bring peace to Valandis?\n\nHonestly, I absolutely love this game. The 16-bit style graphics, the attention to small little details, the woven in humor, and the combat mechanics all shine bright here. The combat doesn't feel sluggish and I actually felt a desire to talk to the NPCs sprinkled across the world, which is not a normal feeling for me. I also liked that, if I started a conversation with a NPC, I could still walk away. I wasn't forced to hear everything that they needed to say. Overall, as a game, I can't recommend this one enough!\n\n\n[h1]Steam Deck Performance:[/h1]\n\n\nYeah it runs near perfectly here. Without any changes, you can keep 60 FPS with 6.5 - 7 hours of battery on a full charge. It may not come as a surprise based on the game's graphical quality, but it is still wonderful.\n\nI did encounter a couple stutters here and there, which stalled the game for a solid 1 second, but that was it. This tended to happen on the first attack in combat or entering into a new place, but it wasn't consistent or enough to stop me from enjoying the game.\n\nChained Echoes brings back a lot of memories when playing it. Not because it is something I played before, but because it reminds me of the good times I had with older JRPGs. Chrono Trigger is a big one that I loved from the SNES era and this game gave me those same feelings I had playing back in the day. On top of that, the game performs beautifully on the Deck without any setting changes. I am happy to say it gets our Best on Deck rating! If you enjoy the SNES JRPG era, this is an easy must-buy.\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th] [url=https://steamdeckhq.com/]SDHQ[/url] is a website made for curating Steam Deck news, guides, and providing optimization/builds for games on the Deck.\n[/th][/tr][/table]\n- [h1]THIS GAME HAS COMMUNITY SERVERS WITHOUT HACKERS.[/h1]\n\nI've been seeing a lot of reviews talking about this game being [i]\"infested with hackers, can't go a single game without hackers, hackers ruining everything\"[/i] etc. but I have yet to see a single hacker in any of my games because I play in community servers. I actually put off going back to this game for the longest time because of these reviews and thought there were only official servers, but I was completely wrong, [b]THERE ARE STILL ACTIVE COMMUNITY SERVERS WITH ADMINS ACTIVELY MONITORING FOR HACKERS.[/b]\n\nI genuinely don't understand why nobody is mentioning the fact that there are community servers, literally none of the top reviews say so. The only reason I didn't go back to this game any sooner was because of this one misconception, but to reiterate, [b]THERE ARE COMMUNITY SERVERS,[/b] just like Battlefield 4, which is the primary reason why BF4 is still alive to this day.\n\n[u]Completely ditch the matchmaking/official servers and just use the server browser,[/u] [b]I HAVE YET TO RUN INTO A SINGLE HACKER BECAUSE OF THIS.[/b] Anyone leaving a negative review because of \"hackers\" are probably still playing on official servers and are most likely just garbage at the game. [b]It's very easy to be really good at this game lmao.[/b]\n\n[u]The game is still very much alive and well without hackers[/u] and is one of the most fun/immersive FPS games ever made.\n\nEdit: I've played this game since launch on Origin and easily have over 200 hours, I only just this week started playing again on Steam for convenience, since low hours matters to some people lol.\n- One of the few exceptions of \"dont buy games on Early Access\".\n\nThis game, on early access, has more gameplay value than a lot of games on full access + 5 dlcs.\n\n- Not For Broadcast is in the simplest of terms, a multi-tasking simulator.\n\nYou sit in a news control room and you have to keep track of multiple things: censoring curse words, switching between cameras, playing ads at the right time, ensuring your broadcast frequency isn't disrupted, as well as keeping an eye out for a bunch of other strange things that appear later in the game.\n\nThis isn't the easiest of games as it requires a good deal of attentiveness. The description isn't joking when they call this \"high-pressure\". You have to rely heavily on both audio and visual cues to make sure your broadcast doesn't get screwed up. As this is the news (and live), there is no rewind or undo button. If you mess up and want to get a good performance grade, you'll need to redo the entire news segment. \nIf you're a perfectionist like me, a 10 min segment can end up turning into an hour of trying to perfect that news segment. As such, I do hope an option to quick save, or at the very least, save and quit, can later be put into the game. It felt rather taxing having to keep an eye on so many things for so long. But as with any game, excellence isn't an art, it's a habit. You'll find yourself turning into a multitasking expert eventually.\n\nThankfully, the actors in the game do a great job of making the experience an entertaining one. There is a good amount of humour written into each broadcast, although I must admit I wasn't quite able to pay attention to all the dialogue, as I was too busy trying to switch to the right cameras whilst ensuring my electricity didn't get cut out. Luckily, the game does have an archive which allows you to playback the broadcasts. Without that, I'd probably be missing out on 70% of what was going on.\n\nThere is also a text narrative, choices matter portion in between news segments. As of now, it feels a little out of place and incomplete, but then again, this is an Early Access review.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that at the time of writing this review, there isn't really any \"propaganda\" aspect to the game yet.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs pretty smoothly. I did encounter occasional crashes if I looked left or right and back and forth too quickly, but other than that, the game is pretty much bug-free. Also, this game has my RTX 2070 Super running at rather high temps for some reason. Rather surprising for a game that doesn't appear to have particularly high-end graphics.\n\nAnyway, I'll be looking forward to see what comes next for this game. Definitely worth the buy despite being Early Access.\n- This game is difficult and fun! But I wold hold off from purchasing right now. The game is very laggy and has many bugs. Here are some pros and cons.\n\nPros: \nFun\nDifficult\nLong\nGraphics\nOn the edge of your seat gameplay\n\nCons:\nLaggy\nLow FOV\nDoes not look as good as what was advertised.\nRTX low is super laggy and unstable\nbugs and glitches\n[spoiler]Not scary jumpscares[/spoiler]\n\nI'ma be honest, the game is fun and I still need to finish it. But if scott did not quit, the game would be more fun and better. Steel Wool kinda floped the game.\n(spoiler)\n\n\nBy the way does anyone have any tips on how to beat the daycare thing? I'm stuck.\n- [h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- No better CO-OP Experience, even decent solo, just remember the golden CO-OP rules:\n-Never push buttons without the whole team green lighting\n-Always Rock and Stone back\n-Never steal another dwarves drink. \n-Dont double dip Resupply pods without asking\n\n\nIf you choose to accept a contract with Deep Rock Galactic, good luck brother, see you in the caves.\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- I backed this game back at the end of September 2013 and have finally played it through to completion. \n\nCandle is a beautifully unique game which takes elements from puzzle, platforming and point and click adventures. The puzzles, although sometimes frustratingly difficult, are all different and use different mechanics keeping the game engaging and fresh. Teku's Candle is such a interesting game mechanic that I really enjoyed getting to know and learn. As previously said, the game looks and sounds absolutely stunning. I don't think I have seen a game that looks this good before and that is attritubuted to every character and scene being hand drawn. Controls can be a bit finicky but not game breaking and you can easily adjust too. I would recommend getting this game because it provides a great whole experience.\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- I normally hate \"retro\" platformers, I never liked Mega Man, only Mega Man X, didn't care much for Shovel Knight but loved Hollow Knight, things like that. The Messenger IS a platformer, even though the second part of the game makes it less linear, and I loved it.\n\nDevs could take a lot of notes here - checkpoints are frequent, boss fights are short and creative and you don't have to go through 2 easy phases to retry a hard 3rd phase, most rooms and even most trick rooms have multiple ways to approach them given your fairly simple moveset. You never have to do anything pixel-perfect to get through but doing things well is massively rewarding. It constantly surprised you with new things but doesn't overstay anything, and completely foreign mechanics introduced are not punishing (Skylands, for example).\n\nA lot of people comment on how great the writing is, and well... it is great. It's sparse but fantastic throughout, with more personality in what amounts to a few pages than most games can give with 10 times as many words (and lore pickups).\n\nFor reference, I completed it with all the challenge collectibles in 14.5 hours, but did not get all achievements nor go through NG+. It is well paced and hard to put down, but easy enough to play in chunks, and I felt like I was learning new tricks up through the end of the game.\n\nDo the thing!\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- The good:\n+ Great story with satisfying finale.\n+ Endearing main cast/characters.\n+ Great world building meets with 90s Indonesia culture.\n+ Pleasant pixel artstyle. The cutscenes visual is amazing, even though i notice few awkward animation.\n+ Nice soundtrack.\n+ Puzzle is mostly well balanced. Not too difficult and doesn't make you feel bored/annoyed either.\n\nThe bad: - \n\nThe ugly:\n* Some pacing problem. There are so many sidetrack a.k.a. \"To complete sub-task C you also must complete sub-sub-task X, Y and Z\" during chapter 2-4.\n* Sometimes you might have to going around in circles to solve certain task or accidentally skipped something.\n\nDespite few flaws, A Space for the Unbound is definitely best game developed by Mojiken Studio and best story-driven/adventure game among all games created by Indonesian developer. If you like side-scrolling/adventure game (such as GRIS, Unreal Life or Oneshot) or game made by Mojiken Studio/Toge production (such as Coffee Talk or When The Past Was Around), you should give this game a try.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.\n- Climbed some rocks\nClimbed hot rocks\nClimbed cave rocks\nClimbed windy rocks\nClimbed snowy rocks\nHad an existential crisis\n\nIn conclusion, good game\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n- My favorite part of history was when Ghandi built the Great wall in 4000 BC for his Jewish army.\n10/10, helped me with history class.\n- A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- As someone who is as obsessed with Sentai/Tokesatsu/KamenRider/PowerRangers as he is with Megaman/RetroActionPlatformers, I would like to tell Domesticated Ant Games:\n\nThank you for developing this masterpiece. I know you didn't make it just for me, but it sure as hell felt like it.\n- My wife left and took the kids\n- Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- This game got criminally low attention.\nThis is basically Risk Of Rain, but Top Down, less budget and same amount of fun.\nI've played just a bit before writing this, and yes, I can already see some flaws in the game, yet it definitely is worth of your attention. Especially with the sale price.\nWill update the review after investing more hours into it\n\n【グループB】\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.\n- This game should have easily swept the game awards for art and theme.  \nthe mechanics, music, visuals, and story blend together flawlessly to communicate the experience of bitter ruin and abrupt descent into calamity.  The gameplay loop is pretty standard for a party based RPG.  Prepare, Enter the dungeon, kill the monster, loot, gain power, then do it again in a tougher dungeon.  The sanity system, very good writing and voice acting personalize the experience and keep you locked in your gaming chair anxious to delve deeper into just how bad things really are.\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- \"Adult Themes from the perspective of an 8-year old\"\nIdk about you, but I wasn't nearly this fucked up as an 8-year old.\n\nJimmy and the Pulsating Mass in three sentences.\n\n--JPM is the most fleshed out, content packed, well made rpg's I have ever played. \n\n --It's unique battle mechanics offer a unique challenge and give players multiple options to overcome them. \n\n--This game has lots of emotional moments , tons of nightmare fuel, countless enimies ranging from cute to scummy, and TONS of exploration. \n\nBottom line: This game is an absolute must buy. It goes waaaaaaaay beyond stereotypical RPG-maker games in-terms of content, quality, and complexity.\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n- The only marginally interesting or entertaining part of this game is it's history.\n\nJanuary 15, 2015: It's sold under the name of H1Z1. It was marketed as an open world zombie survival game, akin to DayZ. I bought it for 20$. The game does not run.\n\nAfter a time, they release a new gamemode; King of the Kill. It's a battle royale mode, made specifically because PLAYERUNKNOWN made a hugely successful battle royale mod for the game but then split off to make his own game (PUBG).\n\nFebruary 5, 2016: KOTK is doing well, so they split it off from the game, both of them costing 20$. They silently abandon the original game, only doing small feature updates and adding nothing but bugs. H1Z1 (The survival game.) is renamed to H1Z1 Just Survive.  KOTK is renamed H1Z1: King of the Kill. Not long after they rename H1Z1 Just Survive to simply Just Survive (Which sounds like a terrible 3$ app game.) and rename H1Z1 King of the Kill to just H1Z1. (H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles.) Development of the original survival game, \"Just Survive\", is still mostly halted.\n\nOctober 24, 2018: Just Survive, the survival game i paid for, is shut down. The game is removed from my, and everyone else's steam library, with no refund. KOTK, or H1Z1, or H1Z1 Battle Royale...or...whatever the crap they named it, is shut down as well, and re-published and renamed as a different game, Z1 Battle Royale, obviously done to alienate the game from it's wretched history.\n\nThe kicker? It's free. Also, it's still called H1Z1 Battle Royale on consoles, and when Z1 BR is run, the window is named H1Z1. \n\nThey made a game said it was like DayZ. It didn't even work. Then they simply deleted it from my library with no refund. Z1 BR is dead, it garners about 3 active players. They actually, legitimately built a fake game and then deleted it for money.\n\nUtterly disgusting development team. When everyone said the original game was going down in flames due to terrible updates, horrible balancing fix attempts that only worsened the balance, and endless amounts of bugs spilling into the game, i sat there, with hope. This is what i got.\n\nThey said the original H1Z1 was originally going to be made free. I was fine, 20$ for instant beta access to a DayZ game was fine. What they didn't say is that it was a blatant lie and they would toss the game in the trash in favor of another random game they made using the original games assets (I told you. They're terrible. Too lazy to even make new assets.) simply because Fortnite was getting popular.\n\nAnd after all that?\n\nThe game sucks balls.\n\nDon't [strike]buy[/strike] download this game.\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- Ignore all the copers who think because they beat Celeste they're a platforming master. This game is a rage precision platformer, it's supposed to be hard, but the best part is that it doesn't even have to be. That's why there is AN OPTION TO SET THE DIFFICULTY IN THE SETTINGS, and if you somehow are too proud to just tone it down a bit to get a better experience and instead decide to blame the game and its developer, then why are you even playing video games in the first place. They're supposed to be fun. This game can be a rage platformer, but it can also be a casual one. It depends on what you want.Will you snail has a great soundtrack, great level design, and super interesting story and lore. Is the game too hard? Change the difficulty. Do you not care about the story? Ignore the optional dialogue. It's that easy. This game is really really good, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise, especially people who can't deal with the fact that the rage game is hard\n- First hour:         This is interesting but I'm not sure I will cry in the end...\nSecond hour:    Ok the story's going somewhere...\nThird hour:        Oh shit...\nFourth hour:      The tears won't stop, please help...\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- $15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- [u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]\n- [h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- Damn this game is so unexpectedly good i can't believe it.\nThe setting is perfect. The idea behind the game is awesome.\nThe graphics are so atmospheric.\n\nThank f*ck that this isn't published by EA.\nStay indipendent Crytek, listen to the Community and the Profit will rain.\n\nRating: FUCK YEAH DUDE!!!!\n- This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n\n- The best war strategy game,, \nI hope in the future they make the similar game (COH3)\nwith modern armies and tanks and modern equipment..\nThey can make USA, British, German, France in one side,,\nand make Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey in another side.\n\nCOH2 Rating Analysis:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGunfires and Explosion: 8/10\nDynamic Weather Effect: 9/10\nAI: 9/10\nUnits and Vehicles: 7/10\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- Alright. Time for a review.\n\nThe launch on this game has been absolutely horrible. Day-zero patch, day-one patch, none of 'em did nothing. My rig is running a 10-series i9 and a 4090 Suprim X GPU. Along with 64 GB ram that should be more then enough. However, it was not. Frames between 10 and 30 fps, with a resting 30-40 when in smaller areas, has been quite common for me. As others have noted, the framedrops appeared to happen when changing \"zones\" in maps, and not when there are many enemies, demanding light-sequences, etc. This made my initial experience a living nightmare, as some fights especially are depending on quick reactions. Try quicktiming a block with 10 fps.\n\nThis has been my experience, and it was horrible. I stared off into the sunset. I cried. I questioned my existence. I murdered people (in real life, as i couldn't kill anything in-game). Until 2 hours ago. Because then, a wild 3,3 GB patch appeared.\n\nThe game is now running smoothly at 150 fps. I have no lag whatsoever when changing zones or being in separation areas, and no issues with combat. Finally the game runs as it should. The story is great, gameplay is better. Combat is more immersive and diverse, and somehow the creators made the game in a way that gives you a ton of new skills and equipment as you play, while still letting you start off with the stuff you had in Fallen Order. Its legendary.\n\nThat sound too good to be true? Well, it kinda is, in a way. Cause i have one more thing to add. People have been reporting game crashes. I have had a total of two crashes in 19 hours, until this patch appeared. Now I've had 9 crashes in 19 minutes. However, the reason I'm saving this for last and don't really care that much is that the crashes are completely connected the archive base on Jedha. This is a small area, and not one you have to spend much time in.  It is, however, quite critical when you do have to go there. As things stand now, i have to reboot the game once or twice to get in, deliver a quest and get back out again. The crashes always happen upon entering or exiting the area, not while inside. So until they fix that... well. I can deal with that.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game, and if you're way too obsessed with this game the way that I am, i'd chance buying it now :) If you have self-control (self-respect...?) you might want to wait a bit more, but I'm pretty confident that the next patch will fix the remaining serious issues for most people.\n\nTLDNR: Game bad then. Game much gooder now. Game goodest next week ish. Caveman out.\n- This is, simply put, what I always wanted Minecraft to be. I played MC on and off for over ten years and generally, you get over that sense of impending danger, and bases built with teamwork don't feel that fulfilling. \n\nValheim fixes all that. Real physics, real combat, real skill levelling (use it to improve it), real teamwork, but most importantly, real danger.\n\nI love it.\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.\n- First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.\n- Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- This is a poor excuse for a Korean mobile port in a long line of them with the lack of sound, spelling errors, bad translations, ugly UI, log-in issues and so much more and it has P2E crypto/NFT garbage and P2W.\n\nNot even the small number of upskirts and jiggly boobs can save this one.\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years.

Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n... Now I have to start over in Argentina. It's fine, Argentina is nice, it means I can tell you about the excellent track designs, which I'm fairly sure much like Dirt Rally, have been taken from real world locations and are distilled down versions of their real lif-\n\n\"Unable to connect to racenet. MyTeam is Unavailable.\"\n\n...\n\nYou know what? None of what I say is going to matter. Because as much as I might wax lyrical about how far Dirt Rally 2 has advanced over Dirt Rally 1 (it's not all good news, but by and large the improvements are genuine and real) there's this one, [b]giant elephant[/b] that keeps wrecking my enjoyment of the career mode.\n\n[H1]\"A discrepancy has been found in the career data. Resetting Career.\"[/H1]\n\n... And there it is.\n\n[H1]He's gonna lose it just about... Now.[/H1]\n\nYou f***. You absolute f***. You mother***king piece of f***ing ***tastic pile of w***. F*** you, and all your f***ing relatives and all the children you have, or may have, now or in the future you b***arding pile of sp*** flavoured sherbets.\n\nFor the last 10 hours, my enjoyment of this game has been punctuated with constant issues with RaceNet attempting to grab me and f*** me from behind. And we're not talking the nice kind of happy f***ing, oh no, we're talking pound you in the ***, elephant d***, ma***ngo grade railing that has made life so teeth grindingly unpleasant that even Codemasters airdropping everyone affected ONE MEEEEEEEELEON CREDITS only offers scant salve to the reaming that RaceNet has given me.\n\nAnd now the game has been opened to the general public, which means RaceNet is about to go down faster than a hooker who just got a stack of benjamins for \"live services\". I do not expect any form of stability for the next few days, and quite possibly my Career to reset again. Motherf***ing piece of ****ing ****ed in the ****ing *** frankenf***ed **** **** ******* <the rest of this rant has been censored by David Cameron's decency filter>\n\nIf they remove RaceNet from the Singleplayer and yes, let me emphasise this - SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE - this becomes an automatic buy, and an automatic thumbs up from me.\n\nAs Racenet stands, breaking down more often than a catwalk model, and being as unreliable as cut-me-own-throat Dibbler's meat pie floaters, I warn all of you. STAY AWAY. STAY THE **** AWAY. THIS **** WILL DRIVE YOU ****ING NUTS. IT'S MADE ME LOSE WHAT'S LEFT OF MY ****ING HAIR. I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT WON'T LET ME. IT WON'T LET ME BECAUSE RACENET IS A PILE OF <the rest of this rant has been censored, again, by David Cameron's decency filter>.\n\nVerdict: [b]Wait for RaceNet to be pulled out of the SINGLEPLAYER CAREER MODE, and then buy it[/b]\n\n-storms back in- OH! AND THE CO-DRIVER FROM DIRT RALLY 1'S VOICE WAS BETTER! FITE ME! -storms out again-\n- i regret buying this on sale\nthis deserved full price\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.\n- It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. \n\nHomeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. \n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. \n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.\n- Game does not become better with release.\nDups AI still retarded, they literally wasting time instead of doing work.\n\nJust a quick example:\nDup can go to the left side of map dig !!ONE!! block, then go to right side of the map and harvest !!ONE!! plant, then go back to the left side of map and dig second block. It's unbelivable boring watching all these.\n\nAnd you still can't destroy ruins, OMG. You can lunch rocket but can't destroy some ruins.\n- I called Grandma a bitch. Grandma immediately murdered me. 10/10 would die again.\n- The Graphics of this game don't match the high price tag\n- So this is a fairly new pixel horror adventure game that I am indeed looking forward to, and i must say it is really good and its worth checking out. \n\nWell since the prologue is very short and sweet i won't spoil the story, there seems to be a super mysterious vibe to it. I just loved how polished the artwork is. Its a fairly new modernized pixel game and you can tell that instantly. Loved the alternative endings so far, strong occult and supernatural vibes, but i didnt feel that much scared playing the prologue except reading the ritual instructions. Not only there are alternative endings but alternative actions too which is quite unexpected, so the game is heading on the right direction. \n\nThis game is worth being voice acted, it's super great and the CG character art isnt bad either. Characterization of the main protagonist is pretty good of what i saw, she is a skeptic and this is a horror game, so far so good. To the devs, all i can say is that the game is going in the right direction and I am expecting more interesting things. \n\nCant wait for the full version to come out!!\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- I've played a fair amount of games during my time using Steam.\n\nI've never felt as emotionally moved by one as I have with OneShot.\n\nI don't know if anyone reading this has played Transistor, but if you are familiar with and enjoyed that game, continue reading for a little context. (I'm going to put it in spoilers because it contains an integral part of how the game functions, which is likely better for you to experience on your own, rather than learn about it from a third party. Be warned!)\n[spoiler]\nTransistor and OneShot are very different games, but both of them share a similarity in that they have been the most emotionally moving games I've played in my entire life. They both have a huge emphasis on characters, both the one you play as and the ones you interact with or are around you. They also both have brilliantly-developed environments, The combination of these two things is one of the major factors in why I've gotten so immersed in them previously.\n\nHowever, OneShot affected me notably more strongly and for much longer than Transistor, and that is for a very discernable reason. In Transistor, you experience the stories of the characters. When it all ends, you're still a third party, experiencing things through the \"eyes\" of the protagonist.\n\nOneShot, on the other hand, features *you* as basically an integral part of the story. Because of this slight difference (which may seem negligible or gimmicky at first), OneShot basically destroyed me emotionally by the end - not necessarily because of how it ended, but that it ended at all. It wasn't just story of some other charismatic protagonists that came to a close.\n\nIt was mine, and with it, my connection to everything that happened in the game.\n\nIt's really hard to put into words... but I really wanted to put this somewhere, in hopes that someone understands and agrees. :D\n[/spoiler]\n\nAnyways, random game comparison tangent over. It's a phenomenal game - easily one of tmy favorite games of all time, my only complaint being that it ended. Extremely solid 10/10.\n\nIf you enjoy story-driven adventures like Transistor, Undertale, Night in the Woods, etc., this is basically a must-buy.\n\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- This game is more than just a driving simulator. It's a landscape experience.\n\nScreenshots won't reveal the full beauty of this game, cause they don't show how daytime and weather change while you drive, how the first sunbeams flash through trees and hills as you leave the night behind, how massive forests reveal as you climb mountain roads and cut through curvy canyons, or the mad contrast of Las Vegas' vibrant colors vs the lonely Route-66-style desert roads... these moments are gold, and define the atmosphere of a game that can be as relaxing or challenging as you want, based on the truck and cargo that you pick – but it will always be a beautiful trip.\n\nAlso, THIS is the game that TRULY deserves the Labor of Love award. In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)... They just make the game better. Every year. For free.\n\nFor years now, SCS keep improving and remain honest, loyal and supportive to their customers and games. What more can you ask.\n\n(P.S. They just revealed plans for official co-op multiplayer.)\n- Most of the negative reviews cover my complaints already. So I won't rehash the ones I've already read. \n\nHere's my biggest complaints: \n\n- Jumpscares have never been compelling to me. Doubly so on VR. Are you trying to injure me in my computer room? Stop. \n\n- Guns are fun. Not having ammo for them is not fun. (The game is pretty generous with ammo but it also encourages tediously conservative behavior, if you just unload clips at shit you'll run out pretty fast) \n\n- \"Continuous Turning\" feels so bad. Like, how can I turn my headset and everything looks smooth as butter, but as soon as I use the look stick for turning suddenly it's all choppy and looks wrong? I'm familiar with some of the motion sickness issues people get with turning in VR games, but this isn't that... \n\n\nThough honestly it seems like they just leaned really into the whole horror thing, which is fine, but also just super not my thing. \n\nIf the mechanics and some design choices had been better I might have slogged through it anyway. \n\n\nGame's beautiful, though, so they got that going for them.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.\n- i would recomend it because the physics are great, the game has 8 or 9 level packs (i dont know if there will be a 9th because there are 7 at the time of this review) the units are diverse, there are a lot of secret units to find and i dont know for the final boss because the most expensive unit artimis isnt a good final boss like the dark pesant in the alphas but i hope that the games final boss unit is actually hard to kill and requires more than 7 archers because that wasnt hard or anything hopefully they will make the most expensive unit actually overpowered and unballanced because that would be a great final boss, the sandbox mode is great i like the custom campains , the custom units arent out yet so i cant say anything about that over all this game is worth the money and if its near a sale time like a few days away from a sale then get it on sale if not then just get it you wont regret it and if it lage turn off all the graphics settings\n- It's horrible. It's annoying to play, it freaks you out, it insults you relentlessly. Yeah, of course I'm recommending it, why do you ask?\n\nWill You Snail is what it says it is. A platformer with traps popping on your predicted path with some meta plot and an evil AI commenting on your actions, mostly with clever insults. But it's also a little more than that, mainly due to the quality of its elements - so the game becomes more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou're probably wondering about the difficulty. Well, good news: there are four settings, and by default they change depending on your performance. You struggle with the level too much? It's lowered. You beat it on the first few tries? It goes up. All with a (not) nice comment from Squid, the antagonist. I personally found the design annoying rather than actually challenging, but I'm quite sure that's intentional. The game's got it all: conveyor belts (that randomly change direction), underwater currents, perfectly timed spikes falling on your head, blocks that cave in on you after you break them. PhD in twatologist design. Due to the ever-shifting nature of the levels, I wouldn't even call this game a precision platformer - it's not about learning the level, but about adaptation. Luckily, the platforming segments are only one part of the game and there's some downtime between them, with optional (but fun) puzzles.\n\nOh, and for reference: I played mostly on difficulty 3 out of 4, sometimes dropping to 2 and rose to 4 towards the end. I found it roughly as difficult as Ori and the Blind Forest's latter sections, harder than Celeste ignoring strawberries, and easier than Garlic.\n\nLet's talk about Squid, the antagonist. The misanthropic, fatalistic, super-intelligent AI trope is pretty old at this point - but Squid is a very good refinement of that trope. It feels like he's really insulting you - the player - not the player character, like GLaDOS did. Mainly because he really reacts to the exact things that you do. You died just before the end? He'll point that out. You keep dying in one spot? He'll let you have it. You died to a spike? Comments about hitting your head incoming. Ran into a bomb? He'll tell you not to collect them. And so on. There so many lines, I never, ever, not once ran into a duplicate. That really makes him feel like a living, breathing person, not an NPC. I mean, he's not living and breathing... you know what I mean.\n\nOn that topic: if you've watched the trailer, you've probably noticed that Squid speaks with a non-native accent. That's because he's voiced by the dev, who's German; and indeed the general writing has this sardonic, matter-of-fact yet earnest quality that will be familiar to you if you know the German style of communication. No, no angry screaming, that's not how Germans talk. Stop watching WW2 speeches and watch some Staplerfahrer Klaus instead.\n\nAnd finally, there's the story. It's a bit meta, no surprises there. I won't write too much about it because I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that it leaves many things out, but gives you just enough info to fill in the blanks. It's rather suspenseful; more importantly, it slowly builds up to... cosmic horror? Existential terror? Perhaps both. Also, it has a very clear message, delivered quite convincingly. Up to you to decide what to do with it.\n\nOverall, Will You Snail is pretty good. I don't think it's as flawless as many reviews make it out to be; the annoying design is still annoying in the end, even if it's thematically correct. Also, the music relies a little too much on the central leitmotif of the game, and it simply doesn't have the grace and variety to pull it off like Toby Fox did with UNDERTALE's soundtrack. Still; those little things aren't enough to wear down the emotional feast presented by this game. I'd say \"Guten appetit\" to this fine escargot meal, but in this case, we are the snails. Enjoy!\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42922988]Curator page[/url]\n- I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- [h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.\n- I couldnt get past the first fight on the inside of the castle because geralt ust sits there and doesnt do anything. Dodging doesnt do anything if i cant kill ther enemy. The combat is atrocious, doesn't let you fight the way you want to (which is utterly asinine and these three things literally made me quit playing the game permanently in 10 minutes time. However since i want to know the story im just going to watch a lets play of this on youtube.\n- Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.\n- [h1] DiRT4 a review and comparison with DiRT Rally [/h1]\n\nAfter 100 hours in Dirt Rally and another 40 in Dirt 4 I feel like I am finally able to give a good comparison of both games while also reviewing Dirt 4. This review will be comprised of 5 categories of which \"Handling and Realism\" is the most important for me at least.\n\n[u] Handling and Realism [/u]\nIt is immediately clear that Dirt 4 is less focused than Dirt Rallye being a sequel to Dirt 3 rather than Dirt Rally but this does not mean Dirt 4 is less realistic than Dirt Rally.\nOn the contrary cars have more weight and are not as floaty as in Dirt Rally. There is no more pogo jumping over bumps and driving techniques like lifting/breaking before jumps are actually useful. In general weight transfer is much better in Dirt 4 than in Dirt Rally lockups are more present than in Dirt Rally encouraging good driving and on-throttle braking. \nGrip levels are quite high in places probably because of the added car weight at least on gravel stages. On tarmac Dirt 4 is way better than Dirt Rally still not very good since there is no tire flex but cars do not seem to drive on rails grip is significantly lowered compared to Dirt Rally and cars are more lively.\nThe real issue Dirt 4 seems to have is on-throttle traction. In general cars have to much traction especially when driving RWD cars on-throttle oversteer is not as progressive as you would expect on a gravel road and traction breaks very sudden thus playing with the gas is not as effective in creating oversteer as it should be making RWD cars quite boring and stale compared to AWD and FWD cars. Weather does not affect handling too much on gravel and tarmac which is a bit of a shame since it seems like there are tools in place for simulating aquaplaning. On snow weather has no affect on handling whatsoever. While both games have deforming snow banks in Sweden leaning still does not really work since the snow banks in both games just feel like guard rails with some padding attached to them more deformation would be better. Damage models are great and internal damage seems to occur more often than in Dirt Rally but the damage model is far from realistic and just not punishing enough a hardcore mode would be very much appriciated since all the necessary tools seem to be in place.\nFFB hasn't much changed since Dirt Rally it still requres a lot of tweaking and is missing many effects and settings other sims like iRacing, Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom have.\nNonetheless Dirt 4 has a more realistic driving experience than Dirt Rallye. \n\n[u] Tracks [/u]\nCodemasters has put a lot of effort into highlighting the procedural track generation tool of Dirt 4. While it is an intriguing idea to have countless tracks and endless content the execution lacks variety. It seems as if the tool is combining certain premade sections procedually. The issue could be fixed if codemasters creates  [b] many [/b] more sections the algorithm can choose from. Also a track editor where users could make their own track sections and tracks would help mitigate repetition and prolong the games lifecycle. Also rally stages are quite short compared to their real life counterparts which can exceed 40km more than twice the length of Dirt 4's longest stages. Codemasters is keen to make Rally stages longer but claims that the Ego engine cant handle stages longer than ~18km. Still repetition is way smaller than in Dirt Rally which has maybe 20 hours worth of original content. The selection of locations is limited due to licensing but diverse enough. Rallycross has more tracks and is more fleshed out than in Dirt Rally while retaining the official FIA branding and Landrush is a nice addition to the game while not necessarily needed.\n\n[u] Cars [/u]\nThe car selection lacks a bit. While most of the really important rallye cars are in the game some classes like WRC are missing completely due to licensing issues making R5 the fastest available class in the game for rallying. Rallyecross on the other hand has all cars you can really wish for since Codemasters hold the license for the FIA World Rallycross Championship.\n\n[u] Graphics [/u]\nOverall the graphics haven't improved much since Dirt Rally. While lighting and effects have improved the overall looks of the game are hindered by the quite repetitive stages. Also variation is very big while sometimes really beautiful e.g. a stage after some rain Dirt 4 can come across really stale looking. Still the game does not look bad the engine just needs a  refresh. \n\n[u] Sound [/u]\nLike the graphics Dirt 4's sound didn't really improve since Dirt Rally. Sounds are generally informative but not much more also Dirt 4 has some layering issues and you probably need some adjusting to get a good mix. The co-driver is really good considering the tracks are procedually generated but bad camber call-outs would be appreciated. Really nothing bad but nothing special either.\n\n[u] In Conclusion [/u]\nWhile Dirt 4 may not be a perfect game in any sense, it improves upon Dirt Rally and still delivers a good challange. Many of the general directions are IMHO correct. Going to procedually generated stages is the way to go in the future but still needs a lot improvement and polish to really become what it is intended to be. Also a better damage system and further evolution of the handling would be much appreciated but still the basics are done right so if you were on the fence buying this game give it a try.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- My first console was an Atari 400 so, I may be a bit partial and nostalgic.\nHowever. its not like I haven't played these games in forty years.\nThis is a truly amazing release that I hope other developers follow.\nIt's a documentary, a museum, and a games collection. They meld into brilliance. This is well worth the price of admission. You get documentary segments interwoven with artifacts, internal documents AND THE GAMES.\nDid you just watch a segment, read the internal documents from development? Yeah? Why not give the game a quick go!?!\nTons of games spanning the beginning arcade to the Jaguar, with all the tasty history thrown in.\n- I haven't played a game that manages to make me cry and fill me with courage this fiercely in a long while. You should definitely play this if you are looking for a good story. You are going to love it.\n- In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.\n- This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.\n- This game is balanced worst then a seesaw at the fat camp vs anorexia recovery clinic end of summer BBQ. resource management is shit how does a farm not produce enough food to feed like 4 people that by definition isn't a farm its a garden. this game has a lot of potenial and i enjoy the concept but its a fail. \nupdate some how they made the game worse with some of their patches if your thinking about buying this game just stab yourself with a fork it will be more enjoyable\nadditional update I forgot how much this game blows so I decided to play again and I think its worse then I remember what a garbage game I mean really do not play this steaming pile of garbage. I hope the devs on this fall down a short but non lethal flight of concrete stairs that will make them go through as much therapy as i have wasted time on this game\n- [i]\"The Display says 'Nothing'\"[/i]\n\"Nothing or 'Nothing'\"?\n[i]\"It's BLANK!\"[/i]\n\"'Blank' OK Great. What is on the Middle Right button?\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"Middle Right!\"\n[i]\"NO!\"[/i]\n\"What you you mean No!? I HAVE THE MANUAL!\"\n\n[h1]**BOOOOOOOOM**[/h1]\n\n10/10\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- Today I stooped playing this game and uninstalled the game because it has a very bad development, very bad events, the worst reward, messy customer support and poor player' gaming, all my friends quit this game until me at the last movement, today a player was attacking and killing troops in the farming nodes for gain a event ranking, 20K a 30K troops vs. 100K troops nice balance very funny, I will not recommend this game.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
