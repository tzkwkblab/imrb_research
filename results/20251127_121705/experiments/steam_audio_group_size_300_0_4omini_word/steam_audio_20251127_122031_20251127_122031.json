      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !",
      "There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.",
      "Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.",
      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",
      "Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.",
      "Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good. After the first 10-20 hours, the music mod made it even better, so is highly recommended to use that mod, even from the beginning",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]",

      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",

      "Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.",

      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck",
      "Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.",
      "This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.",
      "[H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n",

      "Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me.

      "[i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.",
      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!",
      "Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.",
      "My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.",
      "This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n",
      "As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.",

      "I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work.

      "Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).",
      "This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",

If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",

      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.",
      "[b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.",
      "I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.",
      "There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.",

      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

      "So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD",
      "Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.",
      "I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70",
      "New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.",
      "If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.",
      "This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!",
      "Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.",
      "I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.",
      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",

      "One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.",

      "[u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]",

      "This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",

      "Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",
      "Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game",
      "After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.",
      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",

      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",

And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.",
      "Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves",
      "Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.",
      "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",
      "I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).",
      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.",
      "One of my favorite Rockstar games to-date (next to Max Payne).\n\nThe negative review is for the awful DRM they've implemented, where you can't play SINGLE player if the Rockstar Launcher servers are offline.\n\nThe fact that there are people who pirated this game who can play it forever, while the people who payed for it are at the mercy of Rockstar and their DRM servers being online (for an offline game) is a joke.\n\nBuyer beware.",
      "Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n",
      "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",
      "The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!",
      "Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10",
      "probably the first game on steam with tags 'gore' and 'puzzle' :) \nand if gore and puzzles are your thing, you will enjoy this game..a lot :)",
      "Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"",
      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",
      "I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine.

      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",
      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",
      "It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",

      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",

      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",

But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "Death's Door - A Poem Review\n\nThere was a tale of a crow,\nWhose world was bleak and full of woe.\nUntil he stumbled across Death's Door,\nAnd realised after life there was much more.\n\nWith feathers preened, he began his quest.\nTo open this door he'd try his best.\nA sharpened beak and weapon in hand,\nHe ventured forth across the land.\n\nWhere first he came across a witch,\nWho really was an evil... hag.\nHer foes she turned into ceramic pots.\nAnd lives she ruined? It was truly lots.\n\nSecond was the King of all creeks.\nA giant frog with bigger butt cheeks.\nThough his armour was terribly tough,\nHis squishy rump wasn't hard enough!\n\nFinally was the beast on mountain top.\nWhose reign of destruction would this day stop.\nAn abominable creature, all hairy and sweaty.\nWho also went by the name of Betty.\n\nWith three souls collected, the Crow returned.\nTo his final goal with lessons learned.\nWhat more was left for him to explore?\nWell, you'll have to find out and play Death's Door.",
      "Overwhelmingly positive. pfft come on!\nThis game is walking and a puzzle simulator.

Barely got time to shoot anything.",
      "[h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]",
      "i thought it is overpriced eventhough its good, but it am wrong, \nall ascpects in the game are well made with high quality.\nspecial thanks to accessibility setting, very thoughtful for players.\nand it runs perfeclty in steam deck",
      "I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

      "Read all the 10 negative reviews for the game, and not a single positive review is present. All the reviews are fairly accurate to what the game presents to its players. A tacky First-Person Shooter with bad FPS rates, mediocre animations and effects, as well as a cursor that is not even aligned to the target pointer. No comment on the goal, as it is either self-explanatory, or the audio and Sound effects, as it was nothing note-worthy.\n\nIn short, not a single pro is evident in this game, or in my experience during playing. By the end of it, I simply ran Tales of Destruction for the Trading Cards, then uninstalled, and proceeded to Hide from library.\n\nTales of Destruction is not worth a single cent, nor is it worth playing.",
      "Hi, here's an honest review. Yes I was very hyped about this game, like many of us.\n\nPROS\n-Cheap price \n-Besides that, nothing outstadning,  mostly a blatant copy of dayZ.\n\nCONS\n-Poor optimization, I have a 1070 OC edition with a ryzen 1700 and I play on 1440p, in new titles I usually get 70-100 fps on high-ultra, but in this game I get an outstanding 40-70 fps on MEDIUM, usually 55 when in forest, which is bad, since only 6% of users on steam have 1070 and higher gpus.\n-Servers... Before releasing a game, might as well check if servers work, I can't connect to most of the servers, or the server to which I connect are choppy and laggy (or maybe it's the game?)\n-No loot in normal buldings like regular houses and shacks, and by no loot I mean nothing found, besides nails and metal sheets which are essential to some crafting but you can't afford to carry them due to very limited inventory space when you spawn in. And I haven't found a backpack either. The place to loot is the Airfield but it's made challanging with the 2 robots walking around which is alright but since you cannot find anything anywhere it's rather annoying ( I have found guns and gear from dead bodies) \n-The mouvement is not great, feels unfished and choppy and that scroll wheel sprinting is disgusting.\n-The Metabolism, which they emphasised so hard upon. I PERSONALLY detest this system, it looked interesting but when you can't find anything to keep it on point it becomes boring.\n-The graphics are bad. When compared to games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and What Remains of Edith Finch, this game is a shame to UE4\n\nOverall\n-Unfinished, and by that I mean it's not working properly, not the lack of content, I understand that it's early access, but the devs at least have to polish it before releasing it, so that people can play it, and then add new content and mechanics.\n\nI'm extremely dissapointed with the game, I hoped it to be a game to play for 1-2 hours per day with friends to have fun but that's not happening any time soon. I strongly advise to wait for major optimization updates and other patches before buying it",
      "Good lord, do we have a Game of the Year 2017 candidate here or WHAT?\n\nA million twin stick shooters have come and gone over the years since Robotron.  Many have compared themselves and failed.\n\nEugene Jarvis is the creative consultant on this title - so if anything has some \"spirit of Robotron\" in it - this is the game.\n\nThe game is Robotron + Gauntlet with a bunch of secrets rolled in.  As will all good twich arcade games, greed plays a central part in the game.  If you just want to mindlessly blast your way through the worlds - you can.  But you will not be rewarded for it.\n\nScoring high in this game is all about the multiplier - and the multiplier is all about saving humans (which can be harder than it sounds).  You have to chain your pickups of humans to get the highest multiplier.\n\nYou'll bring some great weaponry along the way; Rocket Launchers, Laser beams, smart bombs - even a melee sword.  Powershot is my fav :)\n\nAlong with the regular crew of bad guys,  you'll have special things to find and destroy too.\n\nCROSS PLATFORM leaderboards and local co-op play seal the deal.  Throw in a much of mini-achivements (feats) and you'll be so damn hooked on this game.\n\nIf you love twin stick twich arcade games?  Don't even think about it - BUY NOW.",
      "Beware as you are just looking at the best 4X game that is.\n\nDon't look at my played time here, this game was available for years already from a very unheard of distributor BUT now is available on Steam at last for the people to see it already.\n\nMaybe you are wondering why it costs so much. Well it has 4 expansions build in it already so that's why. But believe me IT'S WORTH IT. If you like 4X games, this is just a must have.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1. The game is not turn based. Everything is done in real time. You can pause the game and speed it up or slow down at your own liking. This may be a + for someone though... \n2. It's not as shiny as some other 4X games so if pretty graphics are what you prefer you may be disappointed.\n3. The game can be demanding even on high end PC's if you run really large galaxy.\n4. Unfriendly UI. If you run huge resolution you will have problems to read the text.\n5. The learning curve... you will spend hours getting into the game. But don't be afraid, huge automation can be set up to help you.\n6. No multiplayer. I don't mind it but maybe you do?\n\nThe Pros:\n\nEverything else. It's the most complex, never ending fun 4X game I have played. Just the way how the AI is done hooked me up. But to make it fair here are some picks for you.\n\n1. Huge amount of races that actually play in character. It's not like in other games where every AI plays the same way but has different stats. Here the AI behaves in the ways how they are described. They play in character like in RPG game.\n2. HUGE galaxies. Trust me you never saw something like this before in other 4x games. Each game can last for dozens of hours if you want.\n3. Set up your game to the last possible thing you can imagine. The start up set up is just incredible.\n4. Automation ... don't like research, or ship design, or diplomacy, or anything else you can imagine? You can automate it. You can focus only on the one thing you like the most!\n5. Pirates ... you can even play as one.\n6. Mods ... do you want 10 more races or to play Star trek 4x? ... You can have it. \n7. Micromanagement ... it can be endless.\n8. The complexity, you can spend hours in design tables that make sense in comparison to Moo3 for example.\n9. Battles, there is very few games that can simulate such large scale engagements over the whole galaxy.\n10. Play it your own way. You can win the game without any battle if you want. On the other side waging wars is FUN.\n\nDo you need to know more? Watch some videos on YouTube from Das24680. He has also full tutorials for those who would need them.\n\n*Update - I have added more Pros as this game deserves it and I have forgot to mention them.",
      "The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.",
      "The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.",
      "Alright. Reviewing a free to play game once again.\n\nThis is a game created by a game lover. RPG lover to be precise. \n\nIt's a very simple Action RPG. The whole game is quite straight forward with minimum amount of puzzle and Mazes. \n\nThere are a few secret chest that's a bit hard to find. \nBut generally it's a very relaxing and non-demanding game.\nThe game itself is very short, 3-4 hours worth but you can possible play longer if you want to.\n\nMusic is basic and okish with no voice acting. (small indie game after all).\n\nThe biggest + for this game are two:\n1. Wonderfully touching story with multiple ending.\n2. Interesting designed boss with 3 different difficulty. \n\nFor some challenge and extra intense action i recommend everyone to beat all 3 boss on hard difficulty.\nThe last one is very hard but just ignore the chaos and act quickly and decisively.\n\nOne extra hint/recommendation i have for everyone is go to keyboard setting and disable sticking key for the final boss.\n(so you have more percision on control when you move around. You want to click up key to move 1 up. To avoid holding up too long and move up 2 square.).\n\nfor Freebie... 9/10.\n\nIf it wasn't free to start i would pay 1-2 dollar for this game and rate is 7/10.",
      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.",
      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",
      "TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!",
      "the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out.

      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "The premise is that you're a passenger on a ship, waking up on the morning after you've murdered your well-to-do husband. From that point, you're free to go anywhere on board to do whatever you can to avoid justice within the time limit. You could just try to play dumb and cover up enough evidence to put your guilt into doubt. If you're more devious you could try to frame one of your fellow passengers. You could even go the And Then There Were None route and murder everyone else on board just to be thorough, if you can pull it off.\n\nOverboard! was clearly designed for replayability. The ship is full of evidence and red herrings to tamper with, desperate schemes to attempt, and secrets to learn. The first playthrough reveals only a small slice of all this, leaving a collection of unsolved mysteries and unfollowed leads to pursue on the second. The second playthrough prepares you for the third, and so on, until finally you beat the game... but there's much more to it than that. Vague, but I don't want to spoil anything.\n\nThis game was released today without any kind of announcement beforehand from inkle. As usual, their writing and design are superb. If you're captivated by the premise, even by a little, you won't regret the purchase.",
      "To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.",
      "Hard to recommend. I enjoyed F1 2020, and this is just that game with the latest cars, slightly updated graphics (ray tracing etc) and a story mode that I found fun, but its about 5 hours of entertainment max. The coop career mode is nice, I enjoy racing with friends. The racing is fun and close when difficulty is tunes, and I enjoy the act of just driving around in this (though some of the kerbs can get knotted).\n\nBig issue is the VIP pass thing, and the attitude it shows. It's even more egregious than F1 2020 - it's front and centre, with some more categories of items to dilute your experience further. By default there are very limited customisation options (even compared with F1 2020), so you might be even more tempted to part with an extra £9 or so just to get the VIP pass. On top of the £55 already spent, with EAs regional pricing making it far more expensive in some areas. That's just grubby. I'm fine with XP based unlocks, but paying for additional cosmetic items in a game like this is predatory and exploitative.\n\nDon't reward them for this. \n\nGet the game if you feel the price is worth it for the story mode and the coop career mode, and you are fortunate enough to have the disposable income. I am, and I did, but it doesn't feel like I got my money's worth this year, to be honest.",
      "It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.",
      "I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",
      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",
      "Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!",

      "This piece of art right here?\n\nGame of the year for someone like me who loves platformers, a great soundtrack, and is a big fan of Metroidvania style games? Oh yeah.\n\nGame of the year for everyone else? Maybe!\n\nLet me tell you some things about this game:\n+Offers a lengthy adventure (I completed 100% in 28 hours and there is still more I could do if I wish)\n+The combat is so tight! Not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash / double jump / wall jump\n+The controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if I died and not simply poor game design\n+The bosses are sick AF and they all have really cool moves / patterns / styles to them\n+The game manages to never feel linear at all, it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world (Hallownest it is called) and leaves the exploring up to you\n+The Soundtrack is bomb. These indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different. It offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely\n+Oh and did I mention the game looks beautiful? Go check images of this game right now like the area \"The City of Tears\" and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery. For a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive\n\nMy real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning: to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned! While the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas I will say some of the combat gets pretty tough. For someone like me I enjoyed it thoroughly as I felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair.\n\nFot those out there who aren't as into these type of games as much I feel Hollow Knight is a great game to start you into the genre. The price is very reasonable, and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype. Give it a try, You won't be dissapointed!",

      "Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…",
      "Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.",
      "Do you like baseball?\n\nI didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.\n\nBut then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. \n\nMore importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.\n\nSo - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.\n\n(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)\n\nFor those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.",

      "I'm glad to say Mr. Grapefrukt and his collaborators have done it again, combining pool, golf, and roguelite-esque gameplay with charming visuals and music to create an absurdly fun little time sink, much like Holedown, which I've played and replayed to completion on every platform it exists on.\n\nI tried to stay unspoiled on the details of the game mechanics before going into it so I could experience everything totally fresh, and I've been delighted by mixing and matching challenge cards and the different ball types that impact how you play.\n\nThe whole thing is charming, and aside from being an obvious extension of Holedown's best design sensibilities, it feels like a fair bit of its ethos took cues from Triband's fresh, novel, and light-hearted takes on sports like golf, baseball, and racing. I really enjoyed What the Golf, and eagerly look forward to the next time Triband makes a game that's on a platform I own, so that inspiration is extremely welcome in Subpar Golf, haha.\n\nIt's hard to put a number on all of the work that goes into a video game over time, but I can say confidently that $10 is more than fair for a really fun game that's been in the works for... I think half a decade (give or take). I say skip the sale and get it now; reward the devs for doing a great job if you have the means! 😊",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "You play as a girl dashing through enemies by pressing 2 buttons. That's literally it. Each stage is the length of a song and as you play more you'll unlock more songs. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a 5 year old who can be easily entertained.",
      "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",
      "This game should have easily swept the game awards for art and theme.  \nthe mechanics, music, visuals, and story blend together flawlessly to communicate the experience of bitter ruin and abrupt descent into calamity.  The gameplay loop is pretty standard for a party based RPG.  Prepare, Enter the dungeon, kill the monster, loot, gain power, then do it again in a tougher dungeon.  The sanity system, very good writing and voice acting personalize the experience and keep you locked in your gaming chair anxious to delve deeper into just how bad things really are.",
      "HAHAHA THIS GAME IS FREAKING PILE OF POOP. 20 FPS. the zombies can go trough walls and cars.  i would just rather buy PoR%n Hub subscription with that money. or i can wipe my own pille of sh/it and give it to someone that needs like like battlefield 2042",
      "I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.",
      "Wow! Let me start by saying that for the last year, I worked in what could be called a high tech arcade. We featured a number of VR stations there, and I watched people playing Beast Pets that entire time. I ended up leaving the arcade before being able to try the game (the stations were only on when customers came in, which is when I left for the day), but since I had watched enough people try it, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of the gameplay -- cute and light. When I saw it hit the Steam store, I was curious to finally play it. I'm more of an FPS/RPG kind of gamer, so I wasn't sure how much I'd be playing it. Well...it's really fun!! There's an immersive aspect to interacting with little AI's in VR that completely changes the experience. For example, while playing Skyrim, you get to have little companions. You interact with them a bit, they follow you around, and that's basically it. But when you're in VR, it actually feels the same as when I'm playing with my puppies. These little guys can fetch, follow a laser, and interact with the environment. There are places for you to explore, and each location offers something unique for the dragons (and you) to play with. And speaking of the environments, they're really pretty! The art style is low-poly, and it works perfectly to create ambiance while allowing you to interact with your new pets. The creators came up with some really clever conventions for interaction that make the experience smooth and hassle-free. This game is great for everyone, and I promise you it's absolutely worth your time.",
      "If you played Counter-strike for Half-life 1. You'll surely like this, because, it has great graphics, gameplay, brings back memories, and plus you won't have to worry about forgetting to get ammo from the shop, because, the shop does all the ammo shopping for you. And it's cheap. If you want to play with me on this game, send me an invite, and maybe I'll play. That's it for my recommendation, have fun fragging. Oh and please don't be a jerk and listen to one of your commanders, because, not cooperating can get you killed in the first place. Sheesh.",
      "I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.",
      "Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.",
      "ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\n\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\n\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\n\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\n\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "good sales pitch for a game. i guess that's the point of being a kickstarter-based video game. everything related to specifically your character and the character action related feels fantastic and looks great and i feel like it scratches an itch no other game really does, and the environments and your animations look great. and yet you're seeing this on a negative review.\n\n-the progression involved with exploring unreality until you stumble onto where you think you should go is miserable. it looks like a mega man x4 level had a bad trip, headache inducing and aimless. the process of finding a lot of secrets is either the trite \"you have a movement powerup, backtrack here and move up there\" sorta deal, or invisible wall shit that i've never been a fan of without decent tells (which admittedly the game sometimes does!)\n\n-combat almost entirely takes place in closed off arenas (not necessarily a bad thing, this game draws heavy inspiration from DMC which does similar) and with the same cast of like 10~ enemies. poise is a chore, even after trivializing the process with the time bomb and the grounded down charge attack, and particular enemies like the guy with the red sword and the caped man are incredibly annoying. there are 2 different instances of an enemy either doing a short version or annoyingly long version of an attack with 0 tell. A lot of the combat is trivial on hard, don't know about\n\n-bosses are a mixed bag. some of them you can loop poise breaks. some of them 2 or 3 tap you. the last one does the latter, makes you slog through a nintendo-ass hands and face boss before you are put up against bootleg senator armstrong with an unskippable cutscene and no checkpoint after the boring phase 1. huge waste of time.\n\n-too many levels just feel empty and lifeless. just a pleasant looking floral jog from arena to arena, felt like nothing and left no impression. \n\n-the movement feels like it has the potential to be insane. there's a million options that all can really push how much distance you can get, and there's a learning curve with how you sequence them all, and there's an entirely separate learning curve with pulse fly though that mechanic feels mostly untapped. \n\n-for a game with a speedrun timer and that kind of carpal tunnel inducing movement, it's really weird that there's not a \"reset to checkpoint\" button or any way to fast travel back to the airship. feels INCREDIBLY bad when you're lost and checking every nook and cranny for where to go next, or when you've ran yourself out of pulse meter when trying to pulse fly in locations that aren't littered with the blue pulse bulbs. special shoutouts to the pyramid, you can screw up especially when trying to do it early and the run is completely dead, but you have to just sit there and wait while you scroll through twitter or whatever. \n\n-music and voice acting quality was all over the place. i'm not more than a hobbyist but a lot of the voices sound like they were recorded on a variety of audio hardware, run through audacity w/ noise reduction and normalization, and tossed in. it's an indie game so please don't take this as the worst critique in the world, i'm sure the VAs were all fellow hobbyists/amateurs and there's literally nothing wrong with that, but a good handful of the yells, insults, and grunts were doing NOTHING for me. some of the music just sounds like penis music, i can't think of a better term. there were definitely a few great tunes on the atmospheric end of things but overall some of them, in particular 2 or 3 boss themes, just kinda sucked. also the segues between combat and atmospheric music was not executed well at all for several areas.\n\n-the fog level in particular had a lot of stuttering especially during combat. not looking forward to the braindead \"works fine on my machine\" type of people, but i'm on a ryzen 9 3900x, a 5900XT sapphire pulse, and 32 GB of 3600mhz ram. I'm pretty sure a machine with a tenth of the power should be able to run a gamemaker studio 2 game, it's on the switch and that thing's basically a leapfrog.\n\ni really wanted to like this game but like i said at the start, it feels like a sales pitch (albiet a great one) with everything not related to the selling point feeling tacked on. I hope this dev learns more about level design in particular and keeps making more games, because this game really does feel like it's designed to appeal to me w/ the mix of genres and the list of inspirations this game seems to wear on its sleeve.\n\ntldr the angled dash memory doesn't let you wavedash, and ur left in a crappy sticky sliding animation when you try. 1/10 can't believe i played this game\n",
      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",

      "most overrated game to ever plague the front page of steam",
      "Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.",
      "As someone who has played the PS2 version roughly 3 years after release, I enjoyed myself. Then I saw that there was an HD remaster. Thought the game was possibly a bit overrated for a remaster, but got it and remembered why I enjoyed it after about halfway through the first level. I even enjoyed it a bit more than the first time around, since I appreciated the way the sound effects synced with the music a bit more the second time. Now Rez Infinite comes out, and the cycle repeats itself...\n\nBut this time, I'm wearing a f**king VR helmet. As someone who played many VR titles before this, and as someone who wanted this game, but put off playing it for full price... it lives up to the hype (it might help that this is the first time actually wearing headphones with it too...) Especially the Area X level. Holy crap especially that level. I only wish it were longer, and I see myself replaying that level alone many times in the future.\n\nThe gameplay may seem a bit dated to some, and it is short. But damn it, it earns it's classic status and it still holds up today. Decent gameplay that grows on you, cool sound track helped immensely by the cool way the sound effects play a part of the song, and great visuals all combine to explain how this game is pretty much the start of any cliche \"games are art\" speech. If you never played it and don't have VR, it's worth $15 (I'm sure. Haven't played this on the flatscreen, but I spent $15 on Rez HD I think, and I didn't regret it). If you have VR and any sort of nostalgia for this game, you probably wouldn't hate yourself buying it at full price, even if you're as cheap as me. If you only kind of liked the game before but didn't really see what the fuss was about, the ten or so minutes of Area X will probably show you why this game has such a cult following. \n\nAnd if you're a Rez fanatic? You'd spend $50 on Area X and still say you got your money's worth, short as it is.",
      "This innocent-looking golf game really is not a golf game. Except it is a golf game. Except it isn't. Essentially, WTG? uses \"golf game\" as its medium, through which it tells a staggering number of jokes and punchlines. Expect the unexpected. But always expect there to be puns.",
      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",
      "I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.",
      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",
      "When reading reviews for this game you'll generally find two camps. There are people who find DW:U incredibly deep and engaging, and there are those who find it incredibly obtuse and frustrating. The problem is they're both right. The game does feature a wealth of features, and you will almost certainly never experience them.\n\nEven for a player like me who is used to impenetrable strategy games like Europa Universalis this was difficult to play. Income see-saws drunkenly from crippling deficit to fabulous surplus and back again depending on what's happening this exact second. Land combat units are jam packed into impossibly tiny UI bars. AI factions have reams of vague, undefined character traits. The encyclopedia technically gives information on everything but is so poorly organized and unsearchable as to verge on useless.\n\nWith time, practice, and a lot of time spent researching on independent websites you can have fun with this game. But for sixty dollars you shouldn't have to, and quite frankly, don't. Find yourself one of the many excellent 4Xs in the store and pass over this ambitious but ultimately flawed gem.",

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "This is a passable if grindy 3D first person family friendly farming \"shooter\" with cartoony artwork.  You have a simple \"vacuum\" gun that you use to capture wild critters, throw them into pens, feed them, collect their stuff, sell it, rinse repeat.  \n\nThe implementation here is of high quality and works well on PC with a range of implementation options.  While the gameplay is somewhat repetitive and grindy, this is decent enough family friendly game that should be considered when on sale.  The retail price is too high, however, this game appears on sale and in bundles often enough.",
      "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",
      "Let's get this straight real quick, if you are brand new to this game and want to buy it, it can be anywhere from a 1-3 star game in your eyes. The game is full of a bunch of glitches, bugs, and somewhat odd mechanics. When starting off, you may find yourself absolutely hating the game, as some of the things that happen are fairly adgetating. Once you have put in some time to figure out some of the major flaws, and how to avoid or fix them, this game is one of the best out there by far. You can do just about anything in this game, from PVP to roleplay. People you meet on this game will most likely be from your worst nightmares, but alot of the time you can meet people that you will know forever. Ever since my first day, I still play with friends that I made on day 1. However, do not trust anyone off the bat. The game can be extremely relaxing and laid back, if you play it that way and avoid the toxic or sweaty players. But if you want some major action, you can jump into a heavily populated PVP server and battle for hours. Personally, I give the game 5/5 now that I have learned how to prevent and fix a lot of the possibly game-ruining glitches and bugs. There is so much to do and learn in this game that I find it very hard to get bored of it. From the people, to the gameplay, this game will test your guts. Do not buy this game if you are expecting something perfect, but if you work around the rough points, you will play this game forever. It is one of the most immersive games ever made, and you will find yourself literally playing until you can't. I don't remember the last time I got off of DayZ and started playing another game, rather than getting off completely.\n\nA few hours later...\nIn love...",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",
      "I'm not saying you should play this game, but if you do you can smoke \"dizzyweed\" with your dad and overthrow a fascist guy whose name literally means penis. Can not explain how much I started hyper fixating on this game.  This has had an irreversible change on my personality.",
      "WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!",
      "Ever wanted to be a futuristic dual wielding samurai drummer with a penchant for slicing boxes? No? You didn't even know that was a thing? Well you will after playing this. \n\nProbably the most satisfying rhythm game out there, Beat Saber turns sword thrusts into dance. With notes expertly timed to the music and directional swipes that lead smoothly into each other creating an almost choreographed flow, you will find yourself naturally completing songs and feeling boss after every single track.\n\nWith a choice of difficulty settings and a huge array of modifiers, it is accessible to many skill levels and makes it perfect for newcomers, parties or just to simply show off VR, while remaining a huge challenge for those who wish to test themselves on the most hardcore difficulties.\n\nBeat Saber is a game that probably should be on the radar of any VR user, as it's pretty visuals and reliance on your motions makes it a perfect fit for VR. If you don't have this game I highly recommend you pick it up, as when you do, you may just find it hard to put it down.\n\nNow if you will excuse me, I have a few more hardcore songs I have to embarrass myself attempting.",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.",
      "As much as I was hyped for a different twist on farming sims, this just falls flat. The whole generation system [i]sounds[/i] good on paper but is just unused. You would almost be more hard pressed to actually age enough to need a second generation than not. Sure you can just opt in to moving along, but I just feel wrong killing off my character like that. As such the whole selling point is just, not a part of the game unless you really seek it out. \n\nSo this just leaves the normal farming sim aspects. Which uh... dont work too well either in my opinion. This game is focused less on skill, leveling, or tool quality despite having far more rpg aspects than most other games of this type. You have entire stat systems behind each charecter, buffs, multiple tool levels and materials. Yet none of it is used. What is used is weird cryptic proverbs that dictate item quality. \n\nWhat I mean is, did you catch that fish normally? Just walking along the river and thought to cast your line? Shame. Dont you know trout can only be caught well on the fourth day of the spring during rain while accompanied by a pet and under the influence of a charm buff? Im not exaggerating too much here either. Crops, fish, fruits, plants, and ore all have up to [b]four[/b] requirements. One per star. Some can be easy, like be skilled in said action, fishing/harvesting etc. But most will be odd things like harvest on the sixth day. Only fish during these hours. Be under a certain buff. Have a certain animal following you. Its all just... odd. \n\nWhats worse is its punishing. You want to just, idk, play the game your way? You want to enjoy this sandbox game at your leisure? Well I hope you are ready to be punished for it. You have to either memorise each and every requirement for hundreds of items. Or, just have a wiki page open at all times. Which just takes away the fun. Cant go fishing today, its not foggy. Cant harvest your grown crops right now, its not druida day. This game has you jumping through hoops, playing on [i]its[/i] time rather than your own. Its a relaxing farming sim, but played like an accountant looking at spreadsheets. \n\nIn essence, if you enjoy micromanaging each moment of your day down to the minute detail, go for it. You will love this game. But if you are looking for a laid back, head empty sim game, look anywhere else. This game will open palm slap you for wanting to play it laid back and to your own beat. I just feel this [u]FARMING SIM[/u] is not at all tailored for the crowd of people who play farming sims.",
      "If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",
      "This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.",
      "Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10",
      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",

Im not sure why that guy put misinformation in the beginning of his review.\n\nIf you have 3 friends, only one of you needs to buy this and invite them through remote play and you will have a BLAST. First session we played 3 hours straight and laughed so hard we gave ourselves a headache.\n\nAlot of love went into making this game and a lot of hidden easter eggs nodding to other games. If you need something to play with your group of friends during quarantine, this is the game!",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",
      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!",
      "Old-school Zelda + Dark Souls + Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind = Brilliance.\n\nThere's not much else to say about that. This game is great. Yes, it may be a bit hard for some people but that's what makes it fun. \n\nHyper Light Drifter is a shining example of what a great game is and what an \"Indie\" game can be. Stirpped down graphics can still be beautiful, no cutscenes and dialogue force the use of imagination (God forbid), both for player and desginer, in both telling the story and weaving it into gameplay, and the ambient music is both mysterious and foreboding; setting an atmosphere that makes the game's world feel all the more vast and unknown.\n\nOne of the best games this year, I'm calling it. One of the best gaming experiences I've had since Shovel Knight. There's no going wrong in picking up this title. It makes me all the more bummed that I missed out on pitching in to the Kickstarter; I would've more than gladly given it money for development AND paying the full price for it when it was released. \n\nReally, it's that good.",
      "Oh boy. This is a beautiful game. There's unlockable items, a hidden boss, lots of enemies, and characters that change your play styles. Numerous ways to make the game accessible for you!\n\nBut is the game fun? I'd say no, the game was just ok. I wasn't really solving puzzles so much dealing with a RNG generator. Ironically the bosses felt slower and more boring than the levels, they are a battle of patience, wait until the potions fall - hit them 3 or 4 times - repeat.\n\nWould I revisit this game after some patches or dlc? No, probably not. Unfortunately I think this game has some base design problems and not content or quality problems.",
      "d00d \nTranslation: The evil-gacha is awesome. Makes it so much faster to get some good stuff. I like that the bonus gauge is easier to fill without resort to \"hit boxes over & over\". The only thing on my wishlist would be a way to lock the cursor to only viable squares when using \"Move\" on a character to stop the cursor getting lost.",
      "First I thought this game is WAY TOO COMPLICATED.\nNow I still think the game is very complex for beginners. And I'm still a newbie.\nI had to watch several youtube videos to get the hang of it.\n\nBesides that, the game is really awesome!",
      "no autosave, plus crashes, so if you put in several hours and never saved - you lost ALL the progress on ALL stages on a random crash, That makes me wanna quit the game and not play it anymore. Overall game is very good, but multiple bugs were never fixed, so you're basically buying the old buggy version of it.",
      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
      "I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.",
      "its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend",
      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",
      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it. I'd be pissed if I'd paid full retail for it. You can find many many games that will be far more engrossing, more entertaining, and just plain longer at this price point.",
      "Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.",
      "Devs are on meth pricing this game at $44",
      "It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.",
      "Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",
      "If you are looking for a review for this game this aint it, but if you want a fire brownie recipe then you are at the right place\n\nIngredients:\n185g unsalted butter\n185g best dark chocolate\n85g plain flour\n40g cocoa powder\n50g white chocolate\n50g milk chocolate\n3 large eggs\n275g golden caster sugar\n\nMethod:\nSTEP 1\nCut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.\n\nSTEP 2\nFill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.\n\nSTEP 3\nRemove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.\n\nSTEP 4\nWhile you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.\n\nSTEP 5\nUsing a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of non-stick baking parchment to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through together and you get rid of any lumps.\n\nSTEP 6\nChop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.\n\nSTEP 7\nBreak 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on how powerful your mixer is. You’ll know it’s ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture in the bowl for a second or two, you’re there.\n\nSTEP 8\nPour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air, so be as gentle and slow as you like.\n\nSTEP 9\nHold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.\n\nSTEP 10\nGently fold in this powder using the same figure of eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first, and a bit unpromising, but if you keep going very gently and patiently, it will end up looking gungy and fudgy. Stop just before you feel you should, as you don’t want to overdo this mixing.\n\nSTEP 11\nFinally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they’re dotted throughout.\n\nSTEP 12\nPour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it.\n\nSTEP 13\nPut in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles in the middle, it’s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another 5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven.\n\nSTEP 14\nLeave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you’re using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut brownie out on its base. If you’re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie with the foil. Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four squares and finally into triangles.\n\nSTEP 15\nThey’ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer for up to a month.\n\n:Mic drop:",

      "This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. \n\nAfter going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.",
      "Overall the concept and idea of the game is good and I would recommend it.

You either have to learn and improve and adapt and overcome or you will be having a bad time as you climb ranks.",

      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n",
      "This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",
      "I did not play this game, only the VR portion with a save game file I downloaded. I cannot stand third person over-the-shoulder cam games, and so I don't care about Ms. Tomb Raider. Frankly, after seeing her mansion, and hearing her stuck up voice, I kinda look upon her as a rich bitch, no matter how good she is at rock climbing.\n\nAs for the VR experience, it was pretty good overall, considering you can clearly tell it's a PSVR/PC thing, and so locomotion and playspace stuff is (almost necessarily) awkward. It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim. IIRC I finished it but had to cheat, or maybe gave up just before the end and watched the conclusion on youtube. If you skip all the book readings and narration (as I did) it will be an hour of hunting and pecking around the castle for objects and secret doors. Not too shabby really. [spoiler]I'd have never gotten to this if not for the save game file though, phew.[/spoiler]",
      "I fucking love this game (and the original Guacamelee as well). It's excellent, challenging platforming with a hilarious sense of humor. I'm an archaeologist who works in Mexico and this game is littered with funny and well-researched nods to Mexican history and pre-history. I imagine that matters less to the non-archaeologists out there, but the fact that they took the time to research all their jokes speaks to the care that went into this game.",

      "First off, the graphics pictured here are NOT what the game looks like. Even in Ultra mode it doesn't come close to looking this \"good.\" \n\nSecond, this game is best played with a controller. Not that I mind this, but after years of mouse + keyboard play it was difficult to get used to switching over.\n\nThird, it says you can alter the dungeon and create new paths and doorways and etc. I received an item that supposedly allowed me to do this but I couldn't get it to work.\n\nFinally, for the price of this game, it should be something spectacular. It wasn't. I've purchased $10 games on Steam that are much better than this. Wait for a big sale if you're interested in this game.",

But really, you should not encourage these games. Who have not bought this game, plz don't buy.",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",
      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",

She got it for me, as a means to help with some of my mental health issues I suppose? But it just was very big miss for me, and kinda made me feel worse.

      "If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game.

      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)",

I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in.

      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",
      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam.

I get it, it's supposed to \"limit\" the playing area (specially for local gameplay) but it punishes people in first place... that's friggin dumb in a RACING game, also also if you go under other track sometimes you can't see sh*t (the going under other track piece seems to be fixed in the final release)\n\n-The car randomly drives itself ???? (maybe it's the antenna thingy I chose at car selection.... would be good a tooltip or SOMETHING so I know wtf is that about)\n\n-NO CONTROL REBINDING OPTIONS..... in 2023 \n\n-If you \"die\" near a checkpoint, though luck pal you WILL miss the next section too cause you won't respawn in time... that's.... just unfun and dumb.\n\n-The \"shortcut\" option definetly does not work, I intentionally crafted a track with cuts and the game will kill you if you try to do those..... good job devs. (This seems to be fixed or working properly in final release)\n\n-Since I couldn't find an online match EVER, I played only in local lobby or vs AI, now here comes the issue, the \"placing\" round locks everyone to the same \"screen\", there is no zoom, you can get trolled by another player preventing you to move to a place to connect track or hazards, rendering your placement turn void and useless, I don't know if this is intentional or just a downside of playing on local mode, you may have free cam in multi, but alas I couldn't try that. BTW.... WHY THERE IS NO ZOOM OPTION\n\nThe good:\n-The games runs smooth as butter, with everything maxed on my midend rig, good one devs\n\n-The cars seem to be varied and with some gimmicks, alas you have NO TOOLTIPS or info what that possible gimmick may be..... why ?\n\n-The track pieces, hazards and weapons are quite varied and some weird shennanigans are ensured to happen, feels like a Trackmania troll track being build in real time 10/10\n\nThe \"mehhh\":\n\n-The weapons/items some of them are mindbogglingly hard to understand wtf they do, there is a grey metallic ball even that seems to do nothing or I haven't figured out how to use it... again... a tool tip maybe ? a section about weapons/items in the main menu mayhaps ?\n\nAnd that's that, sorry if my writing seems a bit aggresive, I just was kinda hyped about the game and it feels a bit of a let down so far.

      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",
      "Write a review they said.. alright.. here it is... \n\nI am at year 5, day 29, Population 250, its winter right now in my little village.. my vikings are freezing, but they should not be. I have stores of coal available to them but they just do not go get it. \n\non a scale of 1 - 10, right now.. a solid solid 7. Why just a 7, well.. its new.. its not finished yet.. and still a tiny bit buggy. \n\nGameplay. It's good.. but i would really like to be able to grab the map with a left click hold and drag it around that way. The camera movement when trying to move the map is slow.. too slow for me. Also the fact that you have to clear whatever you have selected before you can selected the next thing you want to build. \n\nGraphics... VERY nice.. love it.. everything has great detail. People walking really nicely. Now for the not great part.. zoom in on a fishing boat.. boats moving.. oars. well.. they are not moving, I think I have even seen a fisherperson sleeping in the boat as well.. little more on the animations will probably be inserted at a later time.. but I thought it humorous, People also do tend to walk right into the side of a mountain and vanish.. then poof.. they walk back out at another area. \n\nHousing:  Great looks on both the poor and good housing. the option to just upgrade from poor to good would be nice.. \n\nStorage: Storage needs some work.. seriously.. So you have the Wood storage and you have stone storage.. they are basicly the same looking building.. I'd like to see them combined, with that being said.. please add COAL and IRON as well. Make it so that we can set whats to be stored in that building and make it have workers.. that way we can have dedicated vikings move the specific stuff.. \n\nWater: Please allow the area of coverage to overlap.. OR. make the coverage a square so we can fully cover the areas.\n\nFOOD: You gave us these great fields to use. But um.. can we grow something other than wheat and barley? like. potatoes? carrots? I mean, the vikings didn't only eat meat and bread?(but i am also aware the games still in progress)\n\nThe only real issue I have had with the game so far on my system is I was spending point on the tree and when I went back to the village it was gone and I had to reload. I do know once in a while a reload will fix the workers from gathering resources but it doesn't always work.\n\nSo over all I really enjoy this game. I'd definitely recommend  this game to anyone who enjoys city building survival type game. \n\nHope everyone enjoys this game...",
      "[h1]Technology[/h1]\nThe game is (was?) awfully poorly optimized.\nI don't think this game looks good enough for the hardware it requires. Some old RTS games looked similar to this title but required much less to run (I am referencing how the technology is better but the \"PC to FPS\" ratio has gone downhills).\n\nI understand that calculating AI choices and the simulation take a lot of resources, but this is not a game with a few thousand AI players like e.g. EU4 is. This is a relatively small map with just some AI players. This game also does not look that much better than some other RTS/TBS titles and I had FPS issues even with the lowest settings.\n\nI first ran this title with R9 280, so a quite old GPU, but that GPU was fully capable of running many decently modern games. This is IMO unacceptable, the developer can't optimize the game, and releases poorly coded product. I tested different graphic settings and noticed nearly no differences in the framerate.\n\nI then upgraded my PC to the top AM4 CPU and a very new GPU card (6600XT, overclocked) and the game ran fine on the highest settings, but I would not call it super smooth. All the other games run perfectly.\nElden Ring, Baldurs Gate 3, Cyberpunk (absolutely 0 issues in Cyberpunk). I would say CA messed up their game and didn't care to optimize it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is rather decent, it's enjoyable and has a connection to the lore of Warhammer.\nYou can't say a bad word about the general RTS mechanics, the battles and whatever. Just a normal RTS...\n\nIt just isn't the greatest RTS/TBS. Compared to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, or titles like let's say Cossacks, Age of Empires, or maybe Supreme Commander... It is unique in the Total War way, but given the amount of games in the series, it's ... not unique really (I have seen everything this game offers in different titles over the years).\n\nJust a giant simulation with a surprising lack of mechanics for an RTS game (as in economic aspect, diplomacy, map tactics. I think Europa Universalis IV is a good example of a really advanced tactics model in an RTS/TBS game and Civ 6 would be a great example of map design/economics). I personally don't like the maps for real-time battles. These maps seem quite crude and the skirmishes are badly designed.\n\nIn order to inflict maximum casualties you would need to kill every single unit. It should be enough that you break the enemy and automatically win. It's also quite unbalanced. Depending on what you kill first the results can wildly vary (including the AI acting much differently every time and the proposed outcomes of auto-resolved battles are just unhinged).\n\n I probably would like this game more without the \"real-time\" battles, but I assume it's the \"Total War\" way. To me it's time intensive and just not interesting. I liked Warhammer 40k's battles much more. They felt more tactical. Placement of units in this game does matter, but I had more fun playing The Battle for Middle Earth 15 years ago than this. I think the units panic too quickly and the characters don't matter enough.\n\nIt's the closest to the HoMM in terms of map and characters, however it lacks many things that made HoMM great (like tailored character development with meaningful spells and ability to recruit units, find artifacts on the map etc). The cities feel kind of empty, the mechanics are rather poorly described/introduced and just weird for an RTS (for my liking). \n\nI am not sure why there is so little care about the main characters. It would be very cool to build them up, be able to find artifacts on the map (besides the Sword of Khaine, that's just one item) and do something else than just advance some skills in the skill tree. Even if you invest your time in them then they can be sieged and just die.\n\nI also don't like some mechanics, for example the corruption, or slaves (they are not much intuitive. I think they should create clearer GUI and work on the general set of game rules, rather than make every faction different but also following totally different rules. Are we supposed to compete in a campaign and how if we follow different rules?). \nSome game prompts are meant to \"help\" learning the game, but they not always load up and they also don't explain small logos (traits) of the units, it's pretty useless. You need to use web browser anyway. Why to bother?\nIn that aspect - I think the designers totally messed up the UI/UX.\n\n21st August 2023 update: I played Baldur's Gate 3 and imagine they paid enough of work to actually make icons explain the traits of characters or items, amazing is it not? Seems to be lack of care. Every single icon in BG3 is fully explained. I could learn the game's rules and effectively build my characters.\n\n[h1]Genre[/h1]\nThe game is pretty fine, it gives some fun when playing it. Feels like Warhammer I guess? I personally am more of the 40k fan, but a game in the old universe is making lots of sense and the character design with world design are high quality.\n\n[h1] Summary (what made me dump this game also) [/h1]\nThe character design is quite impressive and it seems that they cared about the \"vibe\", but the game is just a money grab. why are there 3 game titles instead of one? What is the main improvement in between all of these titles?\nEach one of them has dozens of DLCs. An average person surely won't spend 300$ just to play more factions.\n\nWhat angered me so much I stopped playing after the purchase:\nThe publisher releases a paid product that claims to have free DLCs - some of them are, but the most important one isn't, and without it the game has got only 50% functionality and feels like a demo.\nRTS game without skirmish mode or some kind of \"do whatever\" mode is a meme. This isn't a DnD campaign board (and ironically such a campaign would allow for much more than selection of 5 heroes on one map lol), but an RTS in a specific universe.\n\nEvery normal RTS game has got a skirmish/free play mode (The Battle for the Middle-earth, Command and Conquer, Supreme Commander, Cossacks, Starcraft. Like every single RTS EVER) and this is especially filthy when you proclaim to release FREE functionality for the title, but then the player gets informed that they must buy TWO titles (WH1 and WH2) to get functionalities in the one they wanted to expand. Such a money grab, and even then the game is still locked behind micro-transactions/DLCs. I wanted to play a game, not donate to the \"poor\" publisher in 10 different ways. If the publisher wants money then they can sell better games.\n\nAwfully lot of DLCs, that don't add many things into the game. The base game doesn't feel like a game, but a rather Free to Play game account, that has 80% of content locked. Choosing from like 4 factions, especially in a game which varies so wildly depending on the faction (the factions aren't meant to be following any common rules it seems).\n\nWhat I also dislike is the publisher urging you to create an account to claim some of the \"free\" DLCs - the purpose is to collect data, and force you into their own website I assume (to raise statistics and show it to the management?). Why bother releasing game on Steam if you can't offer free DLCs to Steam users? I don't want your stupid 3rd party website.\n\nI don't recommend this game. I like Warhammer, but CA is a terrible company. I updated this review and in the meantime there have been at least a few different internet dramas with them involved.\n\nI would personally rather pay 70$ to a company that cares and provides a fun product (e.g. Lorian), than a DLC-locked tech demo... that \"stock\" Warhammer sure is.",
      "This game is a cozy  winter morning, wrapped in a blanket, in the heat of the fireplace with your favorite cartoon on and cup of hot chocolate, it is x-files, it is the music that you hear while walking on the streat, it is people you know,  good people, bad people, real people. This game has the feeling of nostalgia while being totally contemporary and modern.This game is every young adult fear and existential crisis all at once.

      "Usually when writing a review, I like to make comparisons between the title being reviewed & other games I've played through recently. However that's not an option in this case, as there's absolutely nothing I've played that can be compared to wonderfully zany happenings of 428: Shibuya Scramble.\n\nThe story is told through from the perspectives of multiple characters whose paths collide throughout a rather unique day in Shibuya, with choices made by each character having a knock-on effect into the other routes. As an example, if character A needs to take a taxi but character B has already taken it, then character A might not be able to escape misfortune (or maybe they'll avoid misfortune by having avoided the taxi). What does this mean? Bad ends aplenty! From the terrifying to the downright hilarious, 428's bad endings never fail to be engrossing, & make the search for the right path throughout each characters routes even more rewarding.\n\nWhile the game as a whole can be described as a crime thriller, each character route tackles different genres, varying from pleasant things like lighthearted comedy & stories about friendship to harder stuff such as psychological horror & a full on cop drama. Each route is fantastic in its own right, with brilliantly written characters being brought to life thanks to a real sense of individual believability & the expertly crafted presentation.\n\nThe presentation as a whole is a mix of still-shots & live action video, & while there may be a few instances of the text not totally matching up to the photography, it's overall fantastic, with the few video sequences adding a real sense of importance when needed the most. The OST is an absolute banger from start to finish, with a real mix of genres ranging from relaxing shoegaze right up to the dramatic OP. Hopefully Spike can release it through Steam in the future!\n\nThere's also a very generous amount of bonus content, varying from a little quiz minigame (that opens up bonus scenes) to fully fleshed out routes exploring other times & characters within the world. Expect the main story to set you back anywhere between 20-30 hours, with the bonus content potentially adding another 15 or so hours ontop of that, although a lot of it will be gated behind reaching a certain number of bad ends. I'd not blame anyone for using a walkthrough because of this, but I'd really recommend keeping your main story playthrough as spoiler-free as possible, as the bad ends you'll undoubtedly encounter really add to the overall experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some technical annoyances that need to be mentioned. The biggest one regards auto mode, & how it behaves between pages. If there's an especially long sentence that spans across multiple pages, the engine will power through the first half of it & skip right to the second page & the second half of the sentence, making it almost impossible not to miss out on small bits of text unless you scroll up. This is made even worse by there being a few seconds delay between auto mode being manually disabled & being able to look back at the previous pages (or do anything else UI related). I also had issues with the controller uncoupling from the game, despite still being picked up by Steam. The only way I found to remedy this was by restarting the game, but after a while, I just swapped over to using the keyboard, & I'd suggest you do the same.\n\nOverall, while its tech issues & clunky interface can't completely be ignored, they do little to detract from what is otherwise an absolute gem of a character driven crime thriller. With its brilliant characters, wonderful presentation, & incredibly ambitious design, there really is nothing quite like 428: Shibuya Scramble, making it one of the very few VN experiences that I'd consider a must-read for any & all fans of the medium.",
      "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",
      "Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle",
      "2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project",
      "Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.",
      "This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.",
      "In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#21 out of 500+)... it's time for Trails in the Sky: The 3rd.\n\nIf you haven't played both Trails in the Sky and Trails in the Sky SC, go away. This game is not for you.\n\nIf you have played the Trails in the Sky duology, you're almost certainly going to buy this game no-questions asked. Which is fine. Clearly you are a person of impeccable taste and judgment. There are, however, a few things you should probably be aware of before you dive it.\n\nThe 3rd is not really an indpendent game in its own right--it's more of a Gaiden game. It functions mostly as an extended epilogue to the classic Trails in the Sky duology, while also laying down the foundations for future story arcs (upon which much has been built in the Crossbell and Erebonia sequences).\n\nThe game is effectively divided into three kinds of content: lots of dungeon crawling; mostly indpendent character scenes (taking the form of flashbacks) featuring familiar characters from the prior two Sky games; and mini-games! The dungeon-crawling is fairly generic, as the combat system here is more or less the same as in the prior games, and many of the environments you'll be exploring are the exact *same* environments you explored back in FC and SC. There are some new areas to explore, but not many, and personally I found them too abstract to be very interesting. The mini-games are extremely varied and range from incredibly tedious (playin' poker with Gambler Jack) to the amazing (airship shmup!), and can be a lot of fun. The real meat of the game are the character vignettes, all of which are--at the very least--amusing. If you're here, you've likely already fallen in love with these characters, and you'll be glad to know that everyone gets their time in the spotlight here, and the character writing is as strong as ever.\n\nThat said, not everything is sunshine and roses.There is a \"present\" story arc tying all of those flashbacks, dungeons and mini-games together. and... there's no getting around it: it's not very good. The story is short and relatively predicable, with little dialog and less exposition. Our new protagonist, Kevin Graham, performs solidly here--but fails to be quite as interesting as he was in SC--and his lovely lady heroine, Ries Argent, is among the least compelling characters in the entire Trails pantheon, owing mostly to her lack of screenstime. She is absent from entire swaths of the game, and despite her enormous potential, simply does not get sufficient dialog to properly develop. She really only interacts with Kevin, infrequently, and is isolated from the rest of the cast.\n\nUtlimately Trails in the Sky: The 3rd is a bit underwhelming. It's a fun romp, but it could have been so much better with a little more focus on the narrative. The absence of NPCs to talk to, the simplistic structure of the plot, and the underdeveloped heroine are all flaws that are difficult to dismiss.",
      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.",

      "[b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.",
      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "I own quite a bit of games on STEAM... but as I've gotten older I play here or there with my games for like 25 minutes, maybe 45 minutes, then move onto something else.

It's the Cyberpunk Action Game we all wanted 29 and 26 years ago but never got.  Think Elevator Action Returns (Part 2) meets Blood Dragon meets AD Police & Bubblegum Crisis Animes with a bitchin' soundtrack. Everything about this game from the 2D Pixel graphics to the music to the art is just amazing.

      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.

In a year that has been most difficult for everyone, SCS managed to add more than ever: 2 map expansion DLCs, 3 completely new trucks brands (for FREE!), completely rework the lighting system (after complely overhauling the audio engine)...

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",
      "This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!\n\nGreat work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!",
      "[h1]AT A GLANCE[/h1]\n(Full review follows below)\n\n[list]\n[*] [b]Game Name:[/b] The Swapper\n[*] [b]Original Release:[/b] 2013\n[*] [b]Genre Tags:[/b] Atmospheric; 2D; Puzzle-Platformer; Sci-Fi \n[*] [b]My Overall Grade:[/b] A-\n[*] [b]Estimated Playtime (Campaign):[/b] 3-5 hours\n[*] [b]Multiplayer Aspect:[/b] None\n[*] [b]Recommended To:[/b] Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Strong narrative advocates; Puzzle game aficionados\n[/list]\t\n\n[h1]REVIEW[/h1]\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is an enjoyable 2D puzzle-platformer that lacks gameplay innovation but rises above the crowd on the shoulders of its superbly well-designed atmosphere and provocative narrative.  The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you. \n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from [i]bad[/i], but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes. \n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of [b]The Swapper[/b] to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).  \n\n[b]The Swapper[/b] is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]",
      "Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way"

      "No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft",
      "Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.",
      "This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n",
      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.",
      "Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",

      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.",

Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day.

      "Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10",
      "Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.",
      "I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^",

      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",

Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office.

Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.",
      "In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.",
      "I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.",
      "I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.",
      "Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid",
      "Pros:\nGreat movement/mechanics\nEasy to pickup, really hard to master. \nSoundtrack is 10/10. \nVoice actors are high quality, \nNeon Red. \n\nCons: \nyou need an acquired taste of deep fried cringe to get through some of the dialogue",
      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

      "They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.",
      "As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.",
      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.",
      "It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!",
      "Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.",
      "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",
      "This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.",
      "Despite it's lack of official content and the dullness of the career mode, partly due to the sloppy AI, Assetto Corsa is simply the best racing sim ever developed. Everything smells the love of cars, from its jaw breaking physics to the amazing graphics, and just that feel of the car. A new benchmark for racing sims.",
      "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.",
      "At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

      "Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.",
      "Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...",
      "What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life.

      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",
      "Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.",

      "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.

The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",

      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",

      "I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",
      "I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.",
      "THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable.

      "I did not play this game, only the VR portion with a save game file I downloaded. I cannot stand third person over-the-shoulder cam games, and so I don't care about Ms. Tomb Raider. Frankly, after seeing her mansion, and hearing her stuck up voice, I kinda look upon her as a rich bitch, no matter how good she is at rock climbing.\n\nAs for the VR experience, it was pretty good overall, considering you can clearly tell it's a PSVR/PC thing, and so locomotion and playspace stuff is (almost necessarily) awkward. It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim. IIRC I finished it but had to cheat, or maybe gave up just before the end and watched the conclusion on youtube. If you skip all the book readings and narration (as I did) it will be an hour of hunting and pecking around the castle for objects and secret doors. Not too shabby really.

      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking.

      "Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.",
      "I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n",

      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",

      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

      "Pretty alright for being free \nThe visuals are just so yucky tho.\nAlso I don’t understand why a match has to be 20 minutes long, that’s pretty insane and I wasn’t able to check out all the characters and their special abilities because it would take way too long. Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.",

      "First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!",

      "everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.",
      "Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.",
      "Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.

      "i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.",

      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.",
      "Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.",
      "This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this",
      "It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.",
      "The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.",
      "Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier!

      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "[i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",

      "This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",
      "Just another pay to win city builder. If you like this kind of thing that's fine but I get rather bored waiting for the extremely slow build times. I'm not going to throw thousands of dollars on a game like this.",
      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",

Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste.

      "Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value.

You might want to familiarize yourself with Japanese terms though.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe game is presented in 2D pixelated art. As an RPG Maker game, all of its assets and interfaces have been customized, leaving no trace of the default one. It does a good job with the interface though - everything looks beautifully made and straight to the point. The maps are also done well to promote the areas, whether it's the bustling city or the abandoned village. The areas, although usually depicted at night, are still easy to see with their blue-ish colors. Everything is done well to help you enjoy the scenery.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe main selling point of the game is in its storytelling. The world of [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b] is separated into 3 interconnecting chapters, each focusing on someone and the event that was happening around them. The story has a different vibe on each chapter, although one thing is certain: it does a good job in delivering a heartwarming story at the end. I know that creating good storytelling with just 2D sprites is not easy, but this game does it seamlessly.\n\nSince the storytelling focuses on a different person in each chapter, the story is obviously non-linear. You'll find some clues of what was happening to a certain event, which will help you in understanding another event in a bigger picture. It might be hard to keep track of all of them, especially with the recurring names, but the game is kind enough to give you some explanation about it. There might still be some mysteries lying around, but I found it to be concluded nicely at the end.\n\nThe translation might hinder you from enjoying the story to its fullest. It tends to not translate some words, whether it's some locations or simple terms. Some words like \"komusume-chan\" can be translated into English nicely without ruining the sentences, but the translator decides to just give a translation note surrounded in brackets when you encounter it for the first time. People who do not know Japanese terms might have trouble understanding these words sometimes, especially when you also have to remember a lot of Japanese names in the process.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAlthough the story is the main focus of the game, there were times when you have to walk around, whether to initiate another cutscene or solve some puzzles. Important objects are marked in the game, making it easier to locate where you are supposed to look. If you are the adventurer type, some additional dialogues will also available to give a conclusion to some characters after you progress the story. They are not related to the main story though, so you can safely ignore them if you choose to do so.\n\nSeveral puzzles are available to break the repetitiveness. Puzzles in the first half of the game usually take the form of finding some number combinations based on the provided hints, although the second half of the game starts to be more creative with its puzzle-like minigame. I wish that the game will do these puzzles right from the start since it helps to break the monotonous pace.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nThe game lasts for about ~5h. Despite it having two endings, the point of no return is obvious and the game is kind enough to tell what you have to do to reach both endings. That being said, there is no point to replay the game since you can save before the point of no return to unlock both endings at once.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's been a while since I found a quality RPG Maker game on Steam. I didn't expect that it will do a good job with its storytelling. The music, art, and dialogue - everything helps to enhance the story, giving this heartwarming feeling after you read it. I was satisfied with the story, although I admit that I got bored sometimes because of the number of dialogues that I had to read. The game is completely not for those who don't like visual novels, and people who appreciate the story aspect in a game will enjoy it to the fullest.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",

      "Remember the way Monkey Island 2 ended? That weird mess that confused the hell outta everybody? Well, the first 15 minutes of this game manage to \"save\" it completely and suddenly, it all makes sense.\n\nAnd this is just one reason (out of many, many reasons I will experience as I play this game, I believe) you owe it to yourself to play RtMI. \nThank you, Ron!\n\nEDIT: 3+ hours in and I love it!

      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",

      "A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n",
      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",
      "The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.",
      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",

      "I am generally not a big fan of card games, because luck is most often the deciding factor in them, and so it is also here. But there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable. You can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases, so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss. \n\nOf course it is also a rougelike, you will die. But that's part of it, you can have a strategy and get better with every run. It is also addicting in a good way. There are no in game purchases, or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games.\n\nThis is one of the best games that went through Early Access, and the developers made good updates, introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game. They are currently working on a fourth character. They also interact really well with the players, featuring artwork and being active in the discussions.\n\nThere is much to love with this game, I saw myself coming back time and time again. \nI recommend it for everyone =)",
      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n",
      "Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.",
      "Update 09/10/16\nSo they have added 'last man standing' mode which is great. The only issue is now that the controls are too difficult. If they fix this issue it would be a really fun party game and worth porting to consoles.\n\nPros:\n-Good visuals\n-Fun power ups\n-Awesome 4 player local play\n-In general the game is very fun and I believe with a few tweaks the game would be great. If they had done an early access build it would probably have been a great game on full release but there are still a few things that I and the people I played with don't like.\n\nCons:\nNOW FIXED (THEY ADDED LAST MAN STANDING' MODE) -Scoring system *the scoring system is based on how many you kill, we all thought the game would be better if you had lives instead and had to stay alive, when we played this game it was a case of constant kamakaze and not caring because it doesn't matter if you die* REPEAT THIS HAS BEEN FIXED\n-Controls *this type of game obviously can't be played with keyboard and mouse so this is only reviewed using Xbox 360 controller and it still isn't perfect, none of us felt that  had full control of the vehicle*\n\nVerdict:\nFor now I will give it a thumbs up as if they allow you to select scoring system based on kills or based on deaths we would play this a lot. And I think they could easily improve the controls. I hope the devs don't just leave this game to rot as it is a great idea for a local co-op game",

      "[h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.",

      "you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",
      "I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.",
      "Loop Hero is a reverse tower defense (you make the monsters/area to fight your hero) deck builder (determines what you can place) roguelite (there are persistent progression elements) idler (you don't do anything except place the tiles and equip items).\n\nNow, you'll probably be like me and first glance at the game and think it's ugly and a hodgepodge of genre words that is low effort.\n\nI played the demo for 5 hours because of how good it is. It blew me away. \n\nThe game is fantastic.\n\nThe art is great pixel art that looks fantastic in motion.\n\nThe combination of genres works great, everything comes together in an addictive smartly designed manner. You'll constantly be telling yourself just 1 more loop.\n\nThe game has a \"eurojank\" style of design - which is to say, it gives you a very basic tutorial and then not much else is explained. You will do a lot of experimenting discovering cool hidden combos and really trying to optimize your strategy here. There's a solid amount of hidden depth that isn't explained to you. This may or may not appeal to you based on your sensibilities.\n\nThe game currently has 4 acts, a lot of progression upgrades, and the devs have said if the game does well (which it looks like it has) it'll get DLC in the future.\n\nVerdict: PLAY",

      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",

You may find yourself needing to play the early access a few times to find everything.\n\nCons:\n- This is early access folks, there's going to be a few bugs here and there\n- The early access content ramps up really fast and gets very interesting and then ends with you really wanting to know what's next. This is really only a con because I'm really impatient and want the full game asap. ;)",
      "I was lured in by all the positive reviews and the beautiful art style. Once I started playing, I really tried to love this game. I really tried. I got thirteen levels in before I couldn't escape that I hate this game more than any game I can ever remember hating.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why. Many are nitpicks, but there is one overwhelming one: This Game Is Almost Never Fun. I started out enthusiastic, but it wasn't long before all the enjoyment drained out. I went from looking forward to the next level, to only wanting to complete the current one just so it would be over and done with. I could not help contrast Tri with games like Portal or QUBE where, most of the time, the challenge is in figuring out the puzzle. Once you know how it's done, you can do it. In Tri, this is not the case. Realizing the solution just means understanding how much tiring, precarious, exacting, chore-like work you have to do before you can DO the thing you figured out how to do. This is a game where there is no such thing as a simple solution. If solving a puzzle can be made more difficult, it has been. Not in a mentally challenging way, but in a way that feels like having to walk for miles over uneven rocks. (Especially once they introduced having to direct light beams by reflecting them off triangles. This requires innumerable microscopic adjustments each time.)\n\nAnd even that would be fully forgiveable, if the game's difficulty was FAIR. For me, half my frustration came from the increasingly difficult puzzles, the other half came from inconsistent mechanics. Sometimes when I had to run up walls, a triangle that showed I could walk on it would suddenly let go of me and I'd plummet. Sometimes I got trapped in places I should have been able to jump out of. Sometimes lasers would bleed right through triangles I put up to block them (In one case, I had to layer down twenty-four of them). But the worst was the jump. At first I thought it was a nifty idea that if you were jumping towards a high ledge, you could keep pressing space to haul yourself up and over. I grew to hate this mechanic because of how often it failed. Jumping up a simple step could take five or six tries; impotently bobbing up and down going \"HUHHP! HUHHP! HUHHP!\" each time. There were also plenty of times when it seemed like random chance whether a given platform could be jumped to or not. Plus there was the tendency of jumps to send you up and over a thin ledge you were trying to reach, instead of onto. I quicksaved OFTEN.\n\nTri feels like it lives up to its name: they tried. They really did. They had ideas with a lot of potential and the level design is frequently gorgeous. But too often these ideas were implemented poorly, or were not conveyed at a reasonable difficulty level. I quit. I don't want to, and I am massively disappointed to, but I'm giving up and uninstalling this game. I know I'll never see the end cutscene, but honestly, not playing anymore feels like more of a reward to me.",

      "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands.

      "My first console was an Atari 400 so, I may be a bit partial and nostalgic.\nHowever. its not like I haven't played these games in forty years.\nThis is a truly amazing release that I hope other developers follow.\nIt's a documentary, a museum, and a games collection. They meld into brilliance. This is well worth the price of admission. You get documentary segments interwoven with artifacts, internal documents AND THE GAMES.\nDid you just watch a segment, read the internal documents from development? Yeah? Why not give the game a quick go!?!\nTons of games spanning the beginning arcade to the Jaguar, with all the tasty history thrown in.",
      "Melatonin is a simple rhythm game, with a focus on ease of gameplay and calmer sounds.\nIf you're expecting something on the tougher or more upbeat side, this ain't it.  Ironically, I had more fun as I stopped focusing on scoring well, and more fun when I was just feeling the music and half-asleep.  The sounds and songs are quite relaxing lol.\n\nOn the shorter side of games, it still delivers an enjoyable experience in what it offers. The timing is a *little* on the forgiving side, and there are even accessibility options if you need a little more help, such as timing circles, metronome, and a bigger Perfect window.  If you'd rather go for a challenge, a Perfect only option is also available.\n\nControls are quite simple, using [strike]4[/strike] 3 directional keys and an action key (Space by default). In each tutorial, you're told whether you'll need to hit directional keys or the action key, and whether they're held or not, as well as general timing.  For some stages, the instructions don't give you as good an idea as the tutorial itself/timing circles do (Work and Time levels for me).  All good, but in some levels you get tempo changes in the middle of the song that can throw you a bit off, especially if you're just grooving to the audio cues... when you can hear and distinguish them.  Unfortunately, there are a few levels where the audio cues are either far too similar to each other, or happen too quickly to react to.  This can be a bit of a bummer, as I prefer working off audio for rhythm games, as their focus should be lol.  \n\nWhile Melatonin doesn't bring a whole lot to the table, it doesn't need to.  Less is more here, and the art and sound direction definitely hit their target.\nRelax.",
      "If Disco Elysium is a meditation on lost futures and the value of self destruction, Norco answers with an indictment that we might be inhabiting the end times and should hold on regardless. Every scene and character portrait is a painstaking work of art that works along with the dreamy soundtrack to draw you into the gorgeous, hazy bible belt setting. The point and click gameplay is straightforward (and at times a little overbearing with handholding), with small minigame sections to mix things up somewhat, but rewards interacting with the world and the people in it to uncover another small truth about it. I don't think I've come across anything that quite captures the sense of melancholy and unease that dominates the current moment in the 20s.",
      "+Long (&quality) story mode\n\n-Sometimes utterly lost so I have to backtrack or look at playthroughs\n-No skill tree\n-Loading screens\n-Some game breaking bugs so I had to cheat to pass it (e.g. pistons in tunnel) \n-Repetitive: turn this wheel, kill this bunch of enemies to open the lock,...\n-Enemies become bullet sponges on higher difficulty modes\n-No Xen chapters, so quite a cliffhanger...\n\nIn short: it is a decent game because of the good story, but people that recommend it are probably just on a nostalgia trip.",

      "Edit: ARCANE HALLOWS REVIEW (Written Feb. 19 2021)\n\nRoguelike Enthusiast's Caveat: The player's progression is directed in a much longer scale over multiple playthroughs due to the nonlinear nature of exploration unlike Hades or Skul. There is also a higher focus on evading stage hazards than said roguelites, with more control in how you start your run than needing to worry about coordinating a build throughout.\n\nNew Player's Verdict: The most recent large update for the game now makes the game well worth the price. Overall changes to the game makes the early-game far more approachable and increased the player's survivability all around while easing power progression.\n\nNew Resolve system for making powerups far less punishing is great. They added features to reroll power up selections as they add more, same with being able to rerolling character selection now that they added (two more very fun and powerful) new classes. The Skeleton Key, one such new randomized power up, addressed my issues with Fairy Chests which are a major source of character progression. \n\nEvery class offers such a unique playstyle while also having great power in their own right (though right now I feel the weakest classes are Ranger and Mage)\n\nNow if we could be able to rechallenge bosses we've beaten that would put me over the moon\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (Written Feb. 4 2021)\n\nAbridged Verdict: Wait for Arcane Hallows Update (Feb. 18 2021) before purchasing for total content volume that matches RL1 along with additional QoL changes\n\nThe latest update as of writing this review (Far Shores) added 2 whole new areas, I bought EA awhile back but didn't really play much until this update, as the amount of content in the game effectively tripled between the areas, new classes, and QoL additions.\n\nGame is more accessible than RL1 for sure, but seems harder to get into than Hades, especially for people not used to roguelites. Namely, its far more punishing and harder to recover from mistakes.\n\nThings I love: The whimsical charm, the much more varied aesthetics of biomes as well as each biome having unique structures (Axis Mundi being a long hallway that makes it more akin to a Classicvania stage is genius). Classes having much more unique and pronounced playstyles adds much replayability. Boss mechanics and designs are much more complex this time around and the way they test your mastery of heirlooms is excellent. The new Armor System as a separate way to reinforce HP and the Mastery system to get steady stat increases go a long way to helping player progression. I'm seriously hooked on the gameplay loop in a way that I wasn't with RL1, every class is so much fun, and I'm so looking forward to the next update!\n\nMy Gripes: Runes are a total gamechanger that can make your life so much easier. Unfortunately the Fairy Chests that contain them are randomly spawned, and as a new player whether you can actually find and survive to one is a steep uphill road, and sometimes they just aren't possible without a specific class. The execution required for some challenges will be extremely difficult for more casual players and thus their ability to progress overall will be greatly hampered without the likes of things such as a soulsteal rune to recover HP. If there's an algorithm that sorts relative difficulty of Fairy Chest rooms, I would like if there were a way to increase the likelihood of creating Fairy Chest rooms if the player hasn't found any, and gradually make them more accessible until the player finds one. Additionally I would like if every Fairy Chest contained runes until you find them all in a biome, as I've gotten hordes of Gemstones from Fairy Chests before getting another rune or rune upgrade\n\nRelics. I'm looking forward to the Resolve system update because as of now, the hits to max HP are incredibly devastating, especially if you don't find a room that can give you the nectar to increase your max HP again (and even then its a huge gamble since you take a lot of damage from it). Most of them don't really feel worth the tradeoff as of right now, unless you find the War Drum to continually increase damage. If we can get a vendor to \"rent\" one (1) relic among a selection of ones we found for a certain amount of gold or something, similar to heirs that start with a relic without losing max HP would add a certain level of accessibility without removing the randomness aspect of roguelikes\n\nWhile all enemy attacks are technically possible to evade, this isn't always the case when you have certain combinations of enemies (Frostens and Aqua Braces in a room with a floor thats all spikes is so mean ; A;). Sometimes you'll spawn into a room next to a Warg that will immediately headbutt you before you can react and suddenly you take 70 damage. I would appreciate if certain enemies were stationary upon entering a room so you have time to process and react accordingly.\n\nEnemy damage scales extremely fast as you move through the map, along with their attacks becoming more frantic or complex, without means to restore HP and Armor through the specific runes, most classes' having lower max HP get real squishy.\n\nOne of the Duelist class's main attraction is that their talent gives them invulnerability windows with a roll, but it can't always be used of you're in a tight position without much room to move. I hope that they add a small invul window to the Dash heirloom, with runes to increase that window, but make it much smaller than the Duelist's (say 1/5th the time of whatever the window is of Duelist's talent)\n\nAnyways, despite my misgivings with the game I listed here, the game is really fun and a lot more accessible and varied than the original game, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up!",
      "*LOOK INTO SAFETY/SECURITY RISKS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME*\n\n     Playing this game online can be risky as hackers are able find your IP address, mess with your in-game / weapons / health / money, find out your personal information, install rats on your PC & even get into your computer. Although this isn't super common it's still a legitimate thing that people need to know about & should look into before spending their money on this game. It doesn't happen as much to random players but Streamers have to play this game in offline mode whenever they stream themselves playing otherwise the hackers will mess with whatever they're doing by trying to get them banned. \nPlease google \"Black ops 3 PC security risks 2022\". It really is a shame that Treyarch isn't coming back to fix this very serious problem in their game, but let's be real Activision  more than likely isn't letting them. \n\nTL;DR: Be cautious of potential security issues, but I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.\n\nNow for my review:\n     Best call of duty game ever for Zombies. Definitely can be a challenge to find multiplayer matches nowadays but zombie matches aren't hard to find as long as you're playing the \"popular\" maps. The \"less popular\" maps are more difficult to find a match on but it's still possible, especially if you search for a match at the right time of day. This goes for multiplayer as well, if you search for a match during specific times you will be more likely to find matches (I'm not entirely sure when these times are so I wont even leave my guess here). This is likely because of people in different time-zones getting up / getting off work or school and getting on the game.\n     This game is the best thing to ever happen to the Zombies series in terms of gameplay, storyline, progression & more. There are endless tasks, items & surprises in each map that keep you coming back for more and having a different experience each time! It truly is a wonderful & fun game that has offered me more re-play ability than any other game I've ever experienced, especially with custom zombies/mod tools. With community made maps there's literally endless maps/levels to play on, & because of mod tools we not only have the remakes that come with Zombies Chronicles but we also have the visually stunning remakes of Mob of the Dead, Call of the Dead & Town, with Buried as well as Die Rise on the way for 2023/2024! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Call of Duty Zombies / zombies in general or who wants to get into the Call of Duty Zombies franchise.",

      "Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.",
      "owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??",
      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",

      "Alpha, Beta, Finished Product... I hear lots of Blah blah blahs complaining about this game not being out of Alpha after years and years, but it isn't like we've been paying a monthly fee for it.  I paid one time to support this game and I've got years of play out of a product that I enjoy.  There aren't too many games that scratch an itch like this game for me... Open World, completely editable/buildable environment and zombies!  One of my biggest issues with a game that I like is that after I buy it, they release a few DLCs and then move on to their next product.  Alpha, Beta, Finished or Not... the developers have given me years of standing by their product and many updates with new content and mechanics.  For that alone, I love their game!\n\nGraphics: 3 outta 5 graphics, she looks a little dated but they keep updating it... It looks better than it originally did.  There's growth\nReplayability: 5 outta 5\nGameplay:3 outta 5... sometimes she's a little clunky\n\nI definitely still believe that this game is worth buying and that they devs and their product is worth supporting.  Hopefully this is helpful to someone.",

I dont have any special pc rig by any means yet even still i am enjoying this game SO MUCH. The story is so captivating i cant believe it, and the combat system? THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS SO FRICKING AMAZING I CANT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE BATMAN THAN I HAVE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME AND DO YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE BATMAN. THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. THE FLUIDITY OF ALL CONTROLS, INCREDIBLE.

The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want.

      "RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.",
      "This game is great for young kids. By that I mean my 6 yo daughter.\nAs an adult, it kept me entertained for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe controls took only a few minutes to work out, and there's not too much motion, nor too much text on menus, which has encouraged her to read the menu herself.\n\nWhilst the content is light on, she really seems to enjoy it. I put this down the the way the dragons are interactive and respond to her actions. This supports the way she has imaginative play with her stuffed toys.\n\nShe does stuff like:\n- makes up names\n- feeds her dragons\n- pets her dragons\n- playing throw/fetch\n- tells the dragons off for bad behaviour like stealing food\n\nWhen playing shes constantly chatting to the dragons.\n\nI'd love to see stronger personalities show up.\n\nFor example dragons wanting particular props more than others, and a little more interacting between the dragons.",
      "As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.",
      "I cannot help myself but to notice that this game has a failed Kickstarter campaign behind - which is why I was especially surprised and happy at the same time to find out it has been released no matter the odds. \n\nTo keep it short and simple: \"Think outside of the box\" is this game's motto. And it actually gives you an ability to rotate this box. \nCreator put a lot of effort in it. To say that this game is \"short\" is something I cannot do. While it is somewhere around 5 hours long - all those hours are filled to the brim with creativity, surprises, charming voice-over; it does not get repetitive and neither it gets overcomplicated. It is a great mix of involvement through thinking and relaxation. \n\nDefinitely worth it's money.",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",
      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",

      "No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10",

      "I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.",
      "A decent fps, good gore, some awful levels, some good ones, some great ones. Pretty okay overall, I'd give it a 6.5/10, which reflect the current steam review score. \n\nWhy the thumb down then? Because It's a massive step down from both TNO and Old Blood. Level design has taken a turn for the worst, it managed to be even more linear than the first one, there is less weapon, setpieces aren't as grand or fun as the previous games. Dialogue is frankly awful, in my opinion, some of them reaching parody level (the father segments are a joke). Thankfully some characters still shine throughout the game.\n\nI'd still recommend it at the price point of around of around 20$ to 30$. You'll get a decentely fun fps with good gunplay and ok levels. However this is not the direction I was hoping a sequel to TNO would take. This game is a big step back from it. \n\nOne last detail that is highly suggestive, but the head bobbing is awful and mods can't seem to fix it without breaking the game itself. \n",

      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game. Why not let players do beta before before release? But then there is  a question of sale and refund. \n\nBut overall this game does offer amazing soundtrack.",
      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",
      "[i]Don’t be fooled.[/i]\nPlague Inc may look like a great in-depth RTS with which to live out the real-world angst of our modern day viral outbreak, but instead it feels and plays very much like a shallow, casual, arcade, mobile version of that; a great little time waster, but lacks any real depth, intellectual engagement or long-term replay value.\n\nThis may be ok if you’re just wanting to watch the world burn in 10 minutes or less, but if you’re expecting hours of intense gameplay in a hyper-realistic, strategy-based simulation of a global pandemic—with social, economic and geo-political elements to keep you on your toes—then you’ll be sorely disappointed.\n\nHere’s the game in a nutshell.\nYou have one objective: [i]Kill all humans on planet Earth.[/i] Anything short of that and you lose.\n\nHere's the gameplay:\n[b]Step 1.[/b] Choose which country to infect. \n[b]Step 2.[/b] Pop the red and orange bubbles to gain points. Points unlock ‘upgrades’ for your plague. The more upgrades you unlock, the better your chances of winning the game. \n[b]Step 3.[/b] Pop the blue bubbles to slow the progress of the world’s efforts in finding a cure or it’s game over.\n\n[i]That’s it.[/i]\n\nEach plague type, (virus, bacteria, parasite etc.) takes you on the same linear path.\nInfect. Upgrade. Don’t lose.\n\nUgh!!\n\nHere in 2020 with the world ACTUALLY living through a viral pandemic, we’ve all witnessed first-hand the various stages of infections, quarantines and lock-downs.\nThe reactions of global governments.\nThe political turmoil.\nThe economic and industrial fallout.\nThe global panic that ensues amongst the general population.\nThe manipulation of the media in controlling the narrative.\n\nNone of that exists here.\n\nGranted, this game was released 4 years [i]before[/i] the 2020 Crisis, but it just feels like a missed opportunity in my opinion.",
      "I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.",
      "Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.",
      "I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.",
      "HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!",

      "Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!",
      "The game is a masterpiece, just like the first one. After finishing PoE 1, I immediately started with the second one and I was treated to another marvel of a game. Here are some of my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n-Very good main story but the side content is what made this game great\n-Interesting and deep characters, both new ones and some returning from the first game, including companions\n-The story picks up after the events of the first game and is a direct continuation of the first game (just like with Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2)\n-If you still have the savegame-files from the first game, your decisions and consequences from the first game will carry over\n-There is so much lore, if you are into reading and listening to stories\n-A lot of voice-acting\n-A lot of pets you can collect and the equipped one has a small benefit to your party\n-Interesting races and sub-races, each with its own boons and downsides\n-Interesting classes and sub-classes, including the possibility of multi-classes\n-You can retrain your characters\n-You can make a new character to join your party at any time at tavern\n-Item and weapon diversity (including pistols)\n-You have the option to play the game as either turn-based (like divinity original sin) or real time (with game pause, just like Baldur’s Gate)\n-You can sail the seas as a pirate and attack any ship you meet without consequence. The ships on the map will respawn endlessly so you will never run out, which makes them a real great source of income.\n-Besides the ship you are given at the beginning, there are a few others you can buy. Each has its own benefits\n-Ship, crew and sailing require some management, but if you like this sort of stuff you can get real invested in it \n-Exploring the map by ship, if you are into that kind of stuff\n-When engaging other ships, you have a choice between boarding or naval combat\n-Endurance is no longer a thing so you only need to manage your Health during fights. You will like this if you were not a big fan of the Endurance vs Health system from the first game\n-The resting system has improved. Besides taverns, now you can rest anywhere you want as long as you have food\n-No inventory management is necessary. Your inventory is infinite so just pick everything up because sooner or later you might need things like explosives, potions, tools etc.\n-Choice matters, and boy are there a lot of different paths you can choose from\n-Romance options\n-Bounties are fun and offer good experience and money\n-DLCs are a bit shorter than the one from the first game, but they are just as good (will not describe them to avoid spoilers)\n\nThe Bad:\n-Loading screens are too long and too many\n-Just like in the first game, I reached max level at about 2/3 of the game(max level 20) so any experience gathered beyond that was pointless. By the end of the game could have easily reached level 30 if that was a thing\n-Naval combat is scripted, so it might not be as spectacular as you might imagine\n-Exploring islands on foot isn’t so much fun\n-The idea of factions might not be to everyone’s liking\n-After playing for a few hours, the game performance seems to decrease and my pc struggled with running it. Maybe the game has an optimization problem but it’s possibly that this one is on me and the game is fine. This might not be the case for other users.\n\nAdvice:\n-In the beginning of the game, try to reach Neketaka asap and do as many quests there as you can before heading out on your ship exploring the seas\n-Pick everything up. Your inventory space is infinite and you will end up needing diverse items like explosives, traps, tools etc.\n-Always have tools with you: hammer and chisel, prybar, lockpicks, grappling hook. You will really need them from time to time\n-Plundering other ships is a great source of experience, resources and money but be careful not to burn yourself out if you do it for too long\n-If you get stuck on a quest, just do some online research\n-Invest money in your ship and crew as soon as you can\n-Always have a tank and healer in the party\n-Make sure to diversify the skills of your party. It’s always good to have someone with Mechanics, Religion, Athletics or Diplomacy most of all\n-Enchant your items\n-When you get the white/grey colored legendary items, make sure to bind them to the character you equip them on and do the mini-quests inscribed on them to unlock new powers and features\n-Use summons, as they are great for distracting enemies. They can take a lot of hits and also dish it out\n\nMy game experience:\nI played on the classic (normal) difficulty, just like I do with every new game I start, and found the game not very hard but fun. I played the game in real time, because turn-based takes too long. As soon as I got my first ship working, I sailed to Neketaka, found the last companions I knew I wanted on my permanent team (Maia and Pallegina) and just quested away in the city until I had enough money and levels under my belt to start exploring the seas and attack other ships. I never did the scripted naval combat because I was having too much fun boarding the ships and watch my characters fight. My party consisted of my Watcher (Moon Godlike, Chanter, specced in summoning), Eder (because he’s a beast of a tank and has some fun interactions with others), Xoti (gotta have a healer, she’s also fun to have around), Maia Rua (very good ranged DPS and she comes with a pet cause she’s a ranger) and Pallegina, who is an excellent off-tank and support character. Once I took to the seas, I made my fortune by plundering ships, equipped my ship and characters with the best money could buy and then just catered to the different existing factions in the Deadfire, while not loosing sight of my main mission.\n\nI had a great time playing Pillars of Eternity 1 and 2. I consider they offer some great replay value and are great fun if you are into this style of RPG games. If you are a fan of games like the Baldur’s Gate, Icewind Dale, Diablo, Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights and Divinity Original Sin series, you must try PoE 1 and 2.\nI really hope they make Pillars of Eternity 3.\n",
      "I'm gonna give this a thumbs up but with like, idk, a cautionary sideways thumb for maybe. \n\nif I read credits right, it looks like this game had all its programming, art, music, and writing done by one guy, so I have to give respect to that. For a real indie game like this, it's very very good. \n\nBut it's still really flawed. If you're looking for a 2D Metroid game, and you've played EVERY other 2D metroid game, I suppose yeah, go for this one, and I think you'll enjoy it. If you're not a fan of metroid, I would not bother, sadly. This game suffers from a lot of problems from metroid games, and does not fix any, and at times exagerates those problems. \n\nThe art style is very interesting and cool, but the way the levels and map design are, leaves most areas feeling like a mess of unmemorable places. \n\nThe combat is INCREDIBLY simplistic, yet somehow bogged down by WAY too many useless weapons and just kind of badly designed controls. I found there were about 5 weapons that were actually useful in the game out of what seems like more than 10. Most enemies you either cheese, or be cheesed. There's no charge up shots, there's not really much nuance to the enemies or bosses. They have about two attacks and repeat while you dodge the same one bullet pattern and just kind of shoot in their general direction. (I played it on hard by the way. Not a particularly difficult game, but even the slightly challenging stuff felt kind of dull and uninteresting.) \n\nThe music was cool again. nothing quite mind blowing, but it was nice. The world itself seems like a mess, but there are cool ideas. The giant robot people were really cool to see. \n\nOne little idea i really liked is that the LOW HEALTH beep sound is actually in sync with every song in the game. I thought that was really cute, and it's not something I've seen any game do. Sounds dumb, but I give a lotta props to that, it was cool. \n\nWriting is okay. I feel it left more to be desired. There seemed to be an interesting world here that wasn't explored enough. It wasn't bad, I suppose, but not really that great. \n\nThat is kind of this game. It's not bad by any means, but not the best game on the planet. Play it if you're in need of a Metroid game, and I'm certain you will be pleased enough despite the flaws. Even if you're just having a hankering for a platformer and have already played Hollow Knight and some other great ones first, I think you should enjoy this, but don't expect a 10/10 game. \n\nGive it a try if you feel it looks interesting.",
      "I find it hard to describe everything I read, I’m not even the person who usually reviews games in a serious way because of my difficulty in expressing my emotion, however, I felt the need to externalize what I felt in a simple and fast way. \n\nWhat I read is not a game neither a visual novel, it's a story of a life... Everything that’s happened in this story has stolen my heart, there have been so many beautiful moments that will be impossible to forget... \nI found myself crying over tragedies that weren’t mine.\n\nThanks NOVECT for this masterpiece full of love.",
      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.",
      "It's responsive, quick and smooth, the Arrange and Matsuri modes are a treat, and it sounds/looks wonderful. Finally, a better shmup than Crimzon Clover is on Steam! Highly, highly recommended.",
      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "After completing every ending, completing the map, and 98%-ing my save file (I'm not going to hunt down whatever miniscule thing is left), I can sum up all my thoughts on the game with one word: Disappointing.\n\nTo go more indepth, as a standalone game, Blasphemous 2 was alright at most. But compared to the first it feels bland and boring in a number of ways. The few NPCs you see are forgettable, the bosses are forgettable, every enemy feels the exact same. \n\nThe executions, which felt like such a large part of the charm of Blasphemous 1's combat, are practically gone- not only do they happen much less often but there's almost no uniqueness to them, with nearly every enemy having the same animation. While in B1 there were 16 different executions (18/19 if you count certain bosses), B2 has.. 4 or 5 different executions? \n\nIt feels like they give no depth to anyone you meet, friend or foe, nearly all of them being left a complete mystery with not even a single sentence talking about who or what they are. Even the Penitent One feels bland, having gone from a brutal, unstoppable force hell-bent on reaching his goal no matter what, to some unremarkable silent protagonist who kills some things.\n\nThe world and its areas felt boring, less like an actual world and more like a jumble of random locations stacked like tetris blocks. The way the enemies were tossed into them makes them feel like they were all pre-made assets and they had to think of where they fit best, and the result was almost none of them fitting in with where you see them.\n\nEverything felt far too easy, far beyond the point of getting used to the gameplay and learning from the first game. Bosses especially were disappointing, all having too little health, and it felt like only a single boss in the entire game had more than three attacks. \n\nThe rewards for quests and secrets were unfulfilling and unsatisfying, whether it was giving a character an item that was obviously meant for them or slowly searching across every little corner of the whole map for tiny secrets you missed. \n\nThe endings especially were a huge disappointment, and they made it feel like everything leading up to them was entirely a waste of time and effort and took away what little enjoyment was left.\n\nEverything about Blasphemous 1 that made it unique- the worldbuilding, the gameplay, the artstyle and animations- feels like it's all been stripped away and we were left with this generic metroidvania that only vaguely resembles its predecessor.\n\nI [b]loved[/b] Blasphemous, it was and still is one of my all time favourite games, but I really can't say I liked Blasphemous 2. If you loved Blasphemous 1 I would honestly advise against playing this, the whole experience is such a letdown that it's hard to not have the first game spoiled simply by what comes after it. If you don't care, or you haven't played the first yet, then at the very least wait until there's a good sale before trying.",

      "***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want. Use this information to purchase your next operator with the game currency. \n\n",

      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.",
      "No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft",

      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",

      "I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.",
      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.",
      "This is the purest Megaman experience I've had in years. I don't remember the last time I sat down with a Megaman-style game like this and just had pure Fun, and got fully engrossed in it over everything else. 20XX? No. Fangames? No. Even Megaman 11 didn't grab me this hard. This is it. This is the game people wanted when they saw Mighty Number 9 the first time. This is the Megaman successor we've been waiting for.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about it, it'd be the music. It's mediocre at best. It's Meh. It does its job and fills dead air, but I'm not rushing to download the OST any time soon. I can't think of a single track that I went \"wow I need that\" for. It doesn't hinder my opinion of the game, but I would have loved it even more if it had gotten this right.",
      "Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.",

      "[h1]First of all, NISA... the elephant in the room needs addressing.[/h1]\nIf you're going to use D3D11 and try to do stuff multi-threaded, use a 64-bit executable.\n\nMemory allocation and thread pooling work much better in a 64-bit environment. 32-bit doesn't really expand your market share any but causes several compatibility headaches (including memory fragmentation in your resource manager). Please, NISA, stop fooling around with legacy APIs (i.e. WinMM for gamepad input and OpenGL 1.x as you did in Disgaea) and outdated ABIs.  D3D11 / 64-Bit should be the target environment for software longevity.\n\nI get the impression you believe that OLDER means more compatible, but you've got the whole PC development paradigm upside down. Old stuff is simply old, period.\n\nI would encourage you to review the guidelines for authoring Windows Store software, Microsoft's policies for Windows Store are designed to reduce legacy software maintenance problems. You need not follow them, but they will give you a pretty good idea of the APIs and ABIs that are relevant / native / not running through compatibility layer redtape. Do this and I believe you will find PC development much less troublesome.\n\n\n\n\n[list][i]With that out  of the way, I would like to point out that NISA patches their games more than any developer I have ever seen.[/i][/list]\n\n\nI personally believe this game is best suited for the Nintendo Switch, but PC will have a stable version by the time the Switch version ships. I have already authored a number of fixes for texture aliasing that guarantee image quality-wise, the PC version is where you would expect it to be. We just need NISA to polish the rest of the stuff :)\n\nTake early reviews with a grain of salt because NISA's going to be busy patching this game for months if Disgaea is any indication. Price complaints are probably the only aspect of current reviews that will remain valid. I tend to agree, the asking price is not what it should be for a game that's not exactly finished.\n\n\n\n[h1]I am leaving a positive review because I have faith NISA will stick with it, but ...[/h1]\n\n[list][list]You shouldn't rush to buy this game by any means.

      "To be honest, I could've typed this review up years ago when I got this, but I never knew how to make a review. But I'm here now, and I'm doing this... Okay, here we go...\nThe Good(AKA:Everything):\n-Cars go crunch here so you don't have to crash IRL(Though I know that won't stop all of you...).\n-Great cars and maps with nice little details.\n-An INCREDIBLE modding community. There's and ENDLESS supply of content coming out all the time from hard-working individuals, all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap.\nThe Bad(AKA:What bad?):\n-This is on me... but it can get a little boring, as your mostly just crashing cars. There are so challenges to do in game, and there are so many things you COULD do... but I guess I don't have the imagination to do that. Like I said, this is bad on me. No fault of the game.\n-Game is really graphics heavy, so a higher-end PC is recommended. Nothing too fancy, but RAM and GPU are hardest hit... maybe processor too...(I'm not that smart with tech...) But this isn't truly bad, as you probably already have good spec if you're looking to play a physics-heavy game.\n-Load times... They used to be bad, but they've gotten considerably better in recent updates. But... the more mods you get, the more it'll have to load. A good PC should be able to handle it, but just keep this in mind.(I have 100's of mods, and it's not too bad...)\nAnd well, that's it. Sorry this it so long... One of my first reviews, after all. But this game deserves to looked at in detail. If you play it once, you'll come back to it here and there to have more fun. So, in short, I HIGHLY recommend this game!\nIf you read this far, thank you so much! I tried my best here!\n",
      "RPG Maker strikes again!\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is one of hundreds of low effort retro-pixel RPG Maker asset/construction kit flips spamming the Steam catalog, made with the RPG Maker video game construction kit... in their own words, \"Our easy to use tools are simple enough for a child.\"  Like all RPG Maker \"games\", this is essentially a bunch of low quality/canned assets from RPG Maker coupled with a cringeworthy high school anime club fan fiction.\n\nAs with all RPG Maker games, the poor quality engine displays badly in fullscreen and doesn't have full HD support or any graphics tweaking options, making this unacceptable for any dedicated modern PC gamer.  The point can be made that the intention of RPG Maker is to make demos and small games to pass around friends, and shouldn't be used for \"professional\" game development.\n\nLike most RPG Maker shovelware and asset flips, the game features extremely low quality copy + pasted 2D retro pixel art, looks awful, and has even worse gameplay.  RPG Maker is an absolutely terrible construction kit, and never results in games of any reasonable quality or value to gamers.\n\nNotably the developer here couldn't work out how to use RPG Maker to make an RPG... and that's the only thing RPG Maker can do properly... except it's not even very good for making RPGs.  Instead, we have a simple 2D top down action/puzzle game where you blip around badly designed and godawfully bad looking mazes.  It's incredible the developer found a way to make RPG Maker even more crap than it is, this is truly a sensational achievement.  \n\nThe poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the game all-time peak player count was only ONE player.  That's right, only one person ever played this at a time.  When I played this for the purposes of reviewing it, I equalled the peak player count for the game.  OUCH.  The only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 50,000 games for gamers to choose from (over 9,000 completely free titles), the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.\n\n\"Intergalactic traveler: The Omega Sector\" is relatively cheap at $2, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  Gamers who want a good retro JRPG experience would be better off playing the originals, like Final Fantasy, Star Ocean or Chrono Trigger.\n",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",

Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n",
      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",
      "Pros:\nGreat movement/mechanics\nEasy to pickup, really hard to master. \nSoundtrack is 10/10. \nVoice actors are high quality, \nNeon Red. \n\nCons: \nyou need an acquired taste of deep fried cringe to get through some of the dialogue",

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",
      "Ib manages to do for me what so few horror games manage to accomplish, and that is to actually give a sense of unease and dread. Without going into spoilers, it's only a few minutes into the game that things start to tread the path of uncomfortable surrealism, with the art growing considerably more disturbing in how Ib interacts with it, and how the art interacts with her.\n\nWith all due respect to more conventional horror titles, say, Dead Space or The Evil Within, Ib maintains a feeling of dread and discomfort. Enemies can be evaded, yes, but there's a feeling of being stalked while trapped in a world you can't possibly fully understand. \n\nContrast Dead Space remake, where soon enough the horror gives way to cutting off an abomination's arm, then using telekinesis to impale it or another horror with said arm, then simply setting fire to the more mobile enemies.\n\nThis is not, I repeat, not to disrespect games in which reducing enemies to a smoldering heap of charred body parts is an acceptable tactic- there is a time and a place for the cathartic destruction of the nightmares that haunted our closets and lurked under our beds. Ib, however, leans firmly towards the horror and self-preservation of being in a hostile and unknown environment, where the only feasible option is to run, hide, and hope whatever nameless horror eventually loses track of you.\n\nAnd let's face it- some modern art galleries are creepy enough already, even in the daylight.\n",
      "First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",
      "This is my first Formula One game, I never expected before to like this type of games but I do and I'm glad that the 2017 version was my first one because it's very polished and enjoyable.\n\nThe game is basically a simulator of real F1 racing with everything that belongs to it. The gameplay is very similar to what we are used to in Codemasters games - a carrer mode where you choose a team and try to meet their expectations. It's not easy, it needs a lot of skills and I don't recommend playing with a keyboard (I personally use an Xbox controller).\n\nWhen it comes to racing games I'm always mostly interested in multiplayer and I'm pleased that the multiplayer mode works well, it's cross-platform, supports up to 20 players and it's really fun.\n\nThe game was ported by Feral Interactive using Vulkan, the general optimization is great and the performance is very stable. I had an issue with constant crashing after ~5-10 minutes so I sent an e-mail to Feral and their Linux support team was very happy to help. The issue of mine was fixed in less than 3 days and they uploaded the fix on Steam using a beta release channel to let me test it so I'm more than happy with the level of tech support.\n\nNothing more to say, if you are looking for a competitive racing game with decent multiplayer then you shouldn't miss this game.\n\n[h1]System info & performance report[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Platform[/td]\n        [td]Linux | Arch[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Desktop environment[/td]\n        [td]Gnome Shell 3.26[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]API[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU/GPU/RAM[/td]\n        [td]i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]Settings[/td]\n        [td]1080p, high[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n        [td]50-60 average[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\nhttps://youtu.be/UOssSi3a3PU\n[i][b]Note:[/b] ~10 fps loss due to recording[/i]\n\n[h1]Technical side[/h1]\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Available APIs[/td]\n        [td]Vulkan-exclusive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n\t[tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]cross-platform Linux <-> Mac OSX <-> Windows[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Config location[/td]\n        [td] ✓ Good | ~/.local/share/feral-interactive/F1 2017[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Linux version rating[/td]\n        [td]Perfect | 5/5[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Controller support[/td]\n        [td]Excellent (tested with an Xbox 360 wireless controller, \"xpad\" Linux built-in (default) kernel module)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Any issues (fullscreen, performance, crashes...) ?[/td]\n        [td]Not anymore (fixed by Feral)[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Ported by[/td]\n        [td]Feral Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]",
      "The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!",
      "(This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!",
      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",
      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",

      "Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.",
      "[b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.",
      "Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.",

      "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.",
      "This is probably one of the best \"battlefield\" type games out there, i was super disapointed at these days battlefields and want it to go back to those good ol'days battlefields. I got this and some more, amazing maps except from some. I still think the game is amazing, but no game is perfect due to the poor progression system... But they are addressing this with updates to fix this, which is amazing.",
      "I'm seeing a new trend in gaming here: A studio wants to port an oldie but goodie to consoles, so polishes it up a bit, releases the new version on console and gives it as a free upgrade to the PC boys. It benefits everyone, but don't get too excited.\n\nIt's not a stunning remaster, because Mark of the Ninja looked damn good to begin with. To this end, everything only got tweaked a [i]bit[/i]. The backgrounds are a [i]bit[/i] more detailed, the cutscenes are a [i]bit[/i] sharper and more fluid-moving, the lighting effects have a [i]bit[/i] more dynamic range, and the resolution is a [i]bit[/i] better. Less a remaster and more a cleanup. Most of the changes are so subtle and detailed you won't even find them by actively looking for them, but they're there.\n\nIt costs exactly the same as the special edition of the original, and includes the SE content, and if you already own the original's SE, you get the remaster for free. So basically, if you want the full MotN package, there's no reason not to pick this up. I'm just playing through it mostly because Mark of the Ninja is a kickass game with or without 4K. There is no downside to picking this up if you want the base game. Do it.",
      "So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.",

      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",
      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",
      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",
      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "100%'ed the LUCT version of the game and I'm slowly working my way through this version now.\n\nOver all the game itself is solid. If you're reading this, its a brilliant tactics game that helped define the genre. However most of the changes they made in reborn, while innovative, ultimately feel constraining. \n\nFor example, they've limited spell slots to 4, so you can only ever take 4 different spells. One or two of which (missile + indirect) are taken by a damage spell of your choice, leaving you with even less spell customization than you'd think. And its unfortunately the same situation with skills, as one will always be taken up by your weapon skill. \n\nThe cards that drop in battle, while an interesting system on paper, just end up cluttering the field most of the time, often with auto-skill activation up, which most of your units won't even really want compared to the other options. \n\nRandom battles were also removed, limiting chances to recruit to a few key dungeons as well as removing some of the more amusing battle locations from the game. \n\nI've also seen some people complain about the level cap, but in my current play-though of the game, it isn't too much of a concern for me, but it may be for others. \n\nOver all, it just feels like they've taken a step back from what Tactics ogre: Let us cling together, gave us. Yes there's bloat in that version, but it also gave us a feeling of freedom when we were putting our teams together that this version lacks. I am grateful that we saw a remake of this game within my lifetime, but I wish they had improved on Luct, rather than take steps back from it. \n\nIf they ever increase the amount of spells and/or skills you can take, to like 6-8, then I'd probably switch my review to a yes. But until then, with a heavy heart I have to say that this version just isn't as good as Luct so far.",
      "When I originally watched the anime, I heard a number of comments to the effect of 'this was kind of a bad adaptation, the visual novel is a lot more complete' Having completed it, I'm now of the opinion that both the show and the VN are a complete mess.\n\nSpoilers!\n\nGranted, I know WHY zero exists, it makes sense. The ending of the original VN and show needed justification, in some sense they are a great, unearned leap forward. A different Okabe had to go through a lot of character development, growth and maturing to become the person who could create the plan that would lead them all to the world line where no one suffers, that would let the original Okabe deceive the world, change the future without changing established details of the past.\n\nTo that end, SG0 aims to show that growth, to show the necessary suffering of the world, of his friends, of himself that allowed for him to become the person that could reach that future, that could make the right choice.\n\nAt its core, there's a meaningful message about generational suffering, about the meaning of history, about (stepping out of the fictional paradigm of world lines and time travel) how all of the past is needed to create a better future. Daru and other characters help Okarin realize this truth, that the world lines where they've suffered aren't wasted time, doomed worlds, that they were necessary steps toward reaching a better future.\n\nThat's all really great, honestly, so why do I so dislike SG0?\n\nWell, about 5% of the show and VN is about these themes, is about the necessity of growth, about accepting yourself, about the character development that's needed for Okabe. The conflicts are there, they're established, it's all set up, but then what does SG0 do with most of its time? \n\nFunctionally, nothing, it's full of dumb filler, harem tropes, and undeveloped characters that still get a lot of time spent on them. I'm talking about you, Kagari!\n\nThe original VN and show are, at first, a slow-burn mystery with rising tension as SERN closes in and chuunibyou fantasy becomes nightmarish reality. It becomes thrillingly-paced while simultaneously reflective and philosophical about its themes and the events that have unfolded, about the dangers of time travel, about the problems with altering established reality to suit one's whims. Okarin eventually undoes most of his meddling in time, and his final goal is NOT to change the past, but to trick the world that a better future might be made possible, that no one be a slave to fate.\n\nWhat the fuck is SG0 by comparison? It's such a monumental, frustrating mess.\n\nThe conflicts in the beginning are Okarin having PTSD about Kurisu and time travel, Suzuha being angry at him for giving up, Maho and Leskenin bringing Kurisu back into his life through Amadeus, Okarin's communicating with [Kurisu] being kept a secret, Maho's wanting to know more about what Okabe knows about Kurisu, about his time-traveling past. New world line shifts giving Okarin glimpses into horrific potential realities and reminding him that he can't run from his fears forever.\n\nSo much good setup! All the right themes are here! \n\nNaturally, you want these conflicts to lead to confrontations between the involved characters that force them to make hard choices, move the plot forward, and naturally lead to the resolution that we see by the end, with Mayuri going back to slap Okarin, with him rescuing Mayuri and Suzuha from the wastes of the past, with everything linking back up with the ending. \n\nYou want these conflicts to perfectly accentuate the primary themes and purpose of this show, to organically prod at the viewer's mind.\n\n(The VN even has some good ideas to this end, like perspective shifts away from Okabe to other characters. Honestly, great idea. Not even remotely used to the extent it needed to be to help SG0 accomplish its goals, though.)\n\nNone of this actually happens though.\n\nIf I'm giving a generous reading, I'll grant the following interpretation: Kagari is a sort of victim of Okarin's inaction, a living example of his failures. That's what she could be. What is she in practice, though? She's melodramatic and unnecessary. She adds more artificial conflict to the plot that isn't needed. \n\nWe have all the conflicts we need already, we don't need 'Amnesiac girl needs help recovering her time traveling memories, reuniting with Suzuha only to realize that, really, she was brainwashed and is going to kill them all' What the fuck does any of this serve?\n\nIn practice, a lot of these initial conflicts are set on the backburner, or bluntly resolved with little fanfare or zero meaningful thematic movement. Remember, the conflicts I listed as starting SG0 off are really all the show needs to propel its characters forward thematically and narratively toward the end. \n\nYet, we end up chasing Kagari's memories, reuniting her with Mayuri, dressing her up, having her faint, having people try to kidnap her, guarding her. None of it meaningfully moves us closer to the goal than we would've otherwise been had she not existed.\n\nOther themes are left on the table somewhat half-baked. Amadeus and Salieri obviously references the semi-historical fiction of Amadeus Mozart and Salieri's rivalry, well-known for the movie based on their relationship. \n\nMaho feels like the Salieri to the Mozart genius of Kurisu. So, that's a setup for some arc of finding value in yourself, believing in your ability to rise to the occasion, not framing yourself as only being worthy in light of others' accomplishments, etc etc. But, neither the VN nor the show really give these ideas full thematic completion, even if Maho vaguely mumbles to herself about her feelings of inferiority.\n\nThink about how the slow-burn of the original S;G, all the choices the characters make, the themes and ideas naturally flow into the second half, with everything that's happened having meaningful connections to the first half, everything making sense as a coherent whole.\n\nSG0 lacks this coherency completely. It has all its good ideas on the table, ready to play out through character choices and interactions, leading to conflicts, leading to choices, leading to climax, leading to natural resolution. \n\nInstead, it gets bogged down in artificial conflict, fan service, and dumb tropes until the end sort of just arrives, Okarin just kind of up and realizing what he needs to do without much character development having happened at all.\n\nYou'd get the complete experience just playing (or watching the equivalent episodes) the 1st hour of the game, then skipping to the ruined city chapter where he time leaps 2,000 times back to the past, gets punched by Suzuha, seeing Hououin Kyouma reawaken, and then seeing the ending play out. \n\nBasically, watch the very beginning, then watch the very end. Everything else is a complete waste of time.\n\nI don't know how they screwed it up this badly, their work was basically cut out for them, they had the opportunity to make something truly masterful, something that meaningfully added to the contextualization of the original VN and show, made it better.\n\nIt's truly disappointing, and I hope that someday, someone talented enough comes back, retcons the VN and the anime and rewrites them completely.",
      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",

      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",
      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.",
      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",

      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",

      "With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.\n\nIt is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came.",
      "It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.",
      "I really, really wanted to like this game.\n\nI preface this review by saying that Guacamelee 1 is in my top 10 games of all time. I've been a gamer for 33 years. Sotn, Chrono Trigger, and FFVII are my go-tos. G-Melee 1 is a charming and original romp through a metroidvania style genre.\n\nGuacamelee 2 fails so ridiculously hard, it actually makes me sad when I think about it. The puzzles are uninspired, the abilities don't really feel enjoyable, and the platforming elements are just unforgivingly tight for the sake of it. I had all the \"schools\" maxed out before the end, it didnt make me feel any more powerful. I didn't have that super saiyan mode like in GM 1.\n\nThe final bossfight is a 3/10 compared to the first game where it is at BARE MINIMUM 9/10.\n\nI wish I could rank this game higher because I adore the original. However, this became a slog several hours before I could finish it. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. It's light on the humor and story, it requires you to be invested in the previous game. The mechanics aren't new and they threw in some unnecessary tight, like razor thin, platforming into the game.",

      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",

I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you.

      "[h1] Floppy Knights is just boat loads of fun. If you like tactics games, this is right up your alley. [/h1]\n[b]The Good:[/b] \nThe art style. It is just so fun and creative. From the different faces that Carlton, your AI arm and best friend makes, to the enemies, even including the fully drawn cutscenes.\nThe dialogue. Everything that is said between Phoebe, Carlton, and others is tons of fun and gives plenty of plot to be invested in it. Plenty of jokes.\nThe combat, units, and general gameplay. You build a deck of up to 30 cards with a mixture of effects ranging from straight up buffing your units (or dealing damage to them with positive side effects!), to creating lots of card draw. Every turn, you draw 5 cards and your commander generates it's own card every turn. These feel unique, while not being too many of them to create bloat. You can even swap between sets of decks that you have built before you start a level, allowing you different options to quickly switch up your play style. \nThe music. There is enough of a variation of music that has a quick beat to it, that it keeps you wanting more. The songs along, ESPECIALLY the boss music, had me tapping my foot alongside it the whole time.\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nYes, every game isn't perfect. However the singular real flaw I have found is one singular bug that the devs state is rare, and it really didn't affect my gameplay at all. I wasn't able to interact with something on a map, however I was still able to clear the level. The fix was just a simple reboot, and after that I literally haven't encountered it once, at all. They are aware of it and are working on it!\n[b]The Subjective[/b]\nI'm not super great at tactics games, sometimes really taking my time or making stupid decisions. The game's difficulty to myself is fairly difficult later on, however after sitting back, thinking, and playing tactically (hah go figure!), I'm able to overcome the objective by planning around different units and synergies with the cards. There is always a factor of RNG within games that have deck building, but you can always squish the size of your deck if you so choose to.\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI would EXTREMELY recommend this game to pretty much anyone who likes turn based games that require thinking. If you aren't sure if you like tactics style games, I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up and trying it out. You won't regret it!",

      "Steins;Gate Elite is a great Visual Novel when looked at in isolation. The main problem is that Steins;Gate (the original) exists. I don't mind the difference in art styles, that is a matter of personal preference anyway. Graphics in Elite are a lot more animated, images in the original are more static but also more detailed. What I have an issue with is the missing parts in the story.\n\nThere are a few situations where Elite eliminates choices when compared to the original. I won't spoil details, but in one of the early chapters you can choose to ignore or answer a phone call, leading to alternate branches in the story (they join again soon after, but each branch still contains unique content). Well, you can choose in the original. In Elite, you automatically answer the phone, the other branch is no longer in the game.\n\nAt a later point in the game, I noticed that quite a sizeable chunk of a previously linear story progression (not even an alternate branch) concerning Faris was completely cut out. Again, I won't spoil details in case you just want to decide which version of the game to get and don't know the story yet. It has been some time since I played the original, so I might have missed more instances of missing story parts, but at least this one part was really obvious.\n\nThe missing branches and parts are not really relevant to the overall story, but you probably want them if you want to know more about the characters. Elite is more streamlined, but at least all of the alternate endings are still here. So while there is missing stuff compared to the original, there is quite a bit more when compared to the anime. Then again, the anime added more story after the true ending of the original game. I was hoping that Elite added (and maybe fleshed out) this extra content as well, but no luck here, Elite ends at the same point as the original.\n\nIf you don't mind the art style of the original, play that one instead. The second game (Steins;Gate 0) only exists in it's original form anyway. Elite might still be worth it if heavily discounted since it is the only way to get the \"free\" Linear Bounded Phenogram. You can justify it as buying LBP and getting Elite as a free extra.",
      "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",
      "This is mostly a worse version of the much better \"Slay the Spire\". Slightly different gameplay (Inscryption has a 'field' and some very limited mechanics from Gwent-like games), but both are deck builders with card alteration and deck probability as a core mechanic. Really expected better from the reviews and a demo that promised more gameplay aspects than seem forthcoming. Not an awful game, and has potential, but it feels like they took a basic card game and never bothered to balance it or build better guidelines for the randomized encounters. \n\nPros\n-Atmosphere is decent\n-Gameplay core is fine and could have promise but is highly random. \n-The 'scale' system works well in concept - winner must be X damage points above the opponent, not a set amount of life. X is too small.\n\nCons\n-'Roguelike' aspects are minimal so far. Even as I get more familiar with gameplay my runs are as likely to end on the first or second map. Grinding the same level doesn't get you anywhere in terms of improvements, since the end game 'summary' is determined by random cards you obtained during your run... which can be very poor. Even then, these seldom show up on future runs in my experience.\n-Few ways to guarantee what cards/powerups you get if you want to focus on any specific type of build. Additionally certain paths are OP, while others are next to worthless. With STS there are far more viable builds, and while some are better than others, most times you could construct one to get you far.\n-Powerups sometimes do nothing (e.g., Instant kill on a card with zero attack is... worthless, but if you add 1 attack it suddenly works), and sometimes create amazing combos.\n-Highly variable battles, often hinging on 1 turn or card draw. Get your top card first? Battle is won. Keep drawing the wrong 'fuel' (card summoning) source? You've lost. Sometimes you'll get 1-2 cards that are a permanent squirrel card, other times you'll need to spend a 1-2 draw actions to even summon a card.\n-Overall atmosphere is interesting, but highly limited and very repetitive. Narrative only changes when you advance and isn't skipable so spending 1 minute each death doing the same death sequence 5 times in a row ruins it. \n-You can't just quit a run. Also the stupid UI that has you click + drag to use the menu system. \n-The room, which functions as your 'rogue-like' element is limited, and once explored is dull. Late 90's graphics, low light. Puzzles are mostly bound by gameplay and even completing a puzzle and adding a card to the pool of possible draws isn't that useful. \n\nThe game needs more features to allow for 'controlled randomness' (e.g., lock certain starting cards for each run, set a preferred powerups/creature type, start encounters with +1-2 cards in hand, expand # of result possibilities, better 'rarity' parity), better permanent powerups (expand past # of \"helper items\" that can be held), scale needs to be larger (once you get the right set-up the game is over the next turn, conversely some scenarios the computer can 'rush' you and a match is over by turn 3-4). Possibly expand # of slots for cards and allow player to have 2 rows, like AI does - would also allow certain powers to be more interesting.",
      "Game really falls off after Anor Londo. The difficulty starts to come more from tedium, shitty terrain/hitboxes, and cheap shots than any test of reflex or strategy. Bosses can be total snoozefests (Ornstein and Smough, Four Kings, Quelaag) or relentless, cheap bastards (Gwyn, Sif) or even dumb puzzles that rely on at least one death to figure out (Discharge, Bed of Chaos, Gaping Dragon). Actual fun bosses are few despite the total number of boss fights. Try not to fall asleep while waiting for the boss to do the one attack you can actually punish without getting hit by the patented zero frame windup or retarded delayed backswing. Marvel at how touching the air 1 foot away from the boss kills you after he does his big EPIC swing because silly player, you should know the exact dimensions of the hitbox surrounding the 20ft tall demon and his 2 ton hammer. Sigh as you run past all the enemies and time-wasting obstacles again as you try to figure out the one stupid gimmick you need to master.\n\nNow, this game isn't all bad. The game's artstyle and atmosphere are pretty cool and the voice acting is good. Some of the levels are also really interesting and well-designed (Undead Burg and Parish, Sen's Fortress, Anor Londo) even if there are also some really shitty ones (Tomb of Giants, Blighttown through Lost Izalith, Crystal Cavern). Play after the second bell only if you want to see whether you can \"git gud.\" I got gud but I see that this game was popular mostly because AAA games were shit when it came out and because of the multiplayer gimmicks.",
      "Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]",
      "You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.",
      "Since no one with a positive review is willing to explain why, I guess I will.\n\n          Right off the bat, visually, this game is jaw-droppingly phenomenal. The lighting, presentation, and atmosphere has been brilliantly re-captured to ensure older fans from the first game feel like they are returning to somewhere that feels oddly familiar, yet holds many new and unique encounters we have yet to discover. The colors, especially the greens, pop in just the right way to further emphasize the seemingly calm and collected forest during the day that can quickly change into a dark and unsettling nightmare by night.\n\n\tEndnight has again hit the nail on the head with the combat. Considering the old system of charging up momentum to land attacks worked exceptionally well, it's understandable they did not try and reinvent the wheel. Combat has been expanded and smoothed out just enough to keep it feeling fun, fresh and different. Landing hits is just as satisfying as it was in the old game, and mastering these techniques is especially entertaining with both new enemies and their original, upgraded counterparts. \n\n\tAs far as interaction mechanics, the inventory system has been cleverly improved, and Kelvin is a genuinely cool addition to the game. For other friendless losers such as myself, having Kelvin around is good company. Interacting with him is intuitive and straightforward, and losing track of him isn't a problem with the GPS you get right off the bat. Starting off with some way to orient yourself in a map that's five times bigger than the first game is also a welcome change. The \"quick inventory\" while you're on the move is a welcome upgrade as well. The crafting menu has also been improved, separating custom buildings from presets, which makes it easier to keep track of what you can make using custom buildings. Unfortunately, the garbage control scheme returns so for the first five minutes into my new save I was making the game playable instead of... playing the game.\n\n\tBut holy smokes the building is 1000% better than the first game. You still have your already mentioned presets for use in a pinch, and you have the massively improved custom building. Instead of laying out where you want everything to go all at once, you get to pick and choose as you create your desired structure, which makes it way easier to manage your resources while making it, and also allows you to make changes as you see fit. This is a huge step up from the previous game, and it's great.\n\n\tI see some complaints with the performance but I personally had no issues. With the medium preset my game ran at a rock solid 75-80 fps, which is perfectly fine for a game like this. Survival games don't need absurdly high frame-rates; what's more important is certainly the frame times and consistency. And my game would rarely drop frames, it again stayed at 76-77 fps with little deviation.\n\n\tI think that's really this game in a nutshell. The first game, but with pretty much every mechanic getting upgraded and reworked in a positive way (for the most part). There's some reused sound FX throughout the game which I thought was a little disappointing, but there have to be some expectations with a team of just 30 people. People get wrapped up in the fact that visually it competes with triple-A games, but those same people forget a tiny team of 30 put this together, and they are only asking for 30 bucks, which is a steal for a game with this much visual fidelity and replayability. Not to mention the oncoming free updates that will only add more content. It's certainly okay to be critical of a product and point out its flaws, but with expectations in check, this comes out as a pretty solid game."

And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.\n- Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good. After the first 10-20 hours, the music mod made it even better, so is highly recommended to use that mod, even from the beginning\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!! AND NOT THE SAME TWO TIMING PUZZLES YOU GOT IT? YOU WILL DO THIS OK I love pizza tower :)\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- 5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- [H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n\n- [h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading! Please leave a comment if you feel I have left anything of importance out or if you just want to share your thoughts. Cheers!\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- [i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n\n- As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- [b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.\n- I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.\n- There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.\n- Wait. So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands. Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro?

All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- Fantastic party game, great for playing with a group of friends. The track building and weapons make for frenetic, chaotic, fun. Like Mario Kart but with the joy of building levels and traps like Ultimate Chicken Horse.\n- [u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.\n- A game that isnt afraid to be fun for the sake of it, a great game and one you dont see much anymore\n\nA great game to pick up after a long day of work, and you just want to hear some heavy rifts and kill some things.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- 9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- One of my favorite Rockstar games to-date (next to Max Payne).\n\nThe negative review is for the awful DRM they've implemented, where you can't play SINGLE player if the Rockstar Launcher servers are offline.\n\nThe fact that there are people who pirated this game who can play it forever, while the people who payed for it are at the mercy of Rockstar and their DRM servers being online (for an offline game) is a joke.\n\nBuyer beware.\n- Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- probably the first game on steam with tags 'gore' and 'puzzle' :) \nand if gore and puzzles are your thing, you will enjoy this game..a lot :)\n- Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n\n【グループB】\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- + The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane\n+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.)\n+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean\n+ Too many achievements to count for\n+ Too many hours spent in perspective\n+ Best poop simulator EVER!\n\n- Incompatible with social life outside the PC.\n- UPDATE: Had the music on the \"+\" but moved it here. Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating. Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^\n- tl;dr: if you're looking for \"Terraria in space\", buy Starbound. Don't waste 88 hours of your life like I did trying to find the game in this steaming pile of crap.\n\nIt's like Starbound or Terraria! Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.\n\nNow including:\n-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago\n-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have\n-Weapons that all feel the same\n-Confusing progression\n-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)\n-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)\n-Stupid glitches abound\n\nThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.\n1/10.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- SUPER MARIO!......\nsorry  not really :P\nits a platform game yes but nothing like mario\nyou can spend a lot of time in this game and still not master it\nthis is a game thats really good for platform gamers that gt to goodfor mario games\nand a punisher for those who are nt that good in those types of games \nit has lots of humor ad moments that will want to eat yoer fingernaisl to the bones\ni say hell yeah to this game even do it got me mad a few times\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- Pros:\nGreat movement/mechanics\nEasy to pickup, really hard to master. \nSoundtrack is 10/10. \nVoice actors are high quality, \nNeon Red. \n\nCons: \nyou need an acquired taste of deep fried cringe to get through some of the dialogue\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- Despite it's lack of official content and the dullness of the career mode, partly due to the sloppy AI, Assetto Corsa is simply the best racing sim ever developed. Everything smells the love of cars, from its jaw breaking physics to the amazing graphics, and just that feel of the car. A new benchmark for racing sims.\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url]. Your time and support is greatly appreciated![/h1][/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- Like Fallout 4 but with karma,\nAnd reputation\nand ammo types\nand interesting factions\nand without half the npcs being essential\nand with interesting characters\nand good dlc\nand interesting companions\nand interesting world\nand cazadors\nand with more than 2 types of shotguns\nand with unique weapons actually meaning something\nand immersion\nand the ability to actually make your character how you want\nand with good skills\nand starting SPECIAL skills meaning something\nAnd actually being a solid 10/10\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- I did not play this game, only the VR portion with a save game file I downloaded. I cannot stand third person over-the-shoulder cam games, and so I don't care about Ms. Tomb Raider. Frankly, after seeing her mansion, and hearing her stuck up voice, I kinda look upon her as a rich bitch, no matter how good she is at rock climbing.\n\nAs for the VR experience, it was pretty good overall, considering you can clearly tell it's a PSVR/PC thing, and so locomotion and playspace stuff is (almost necessarily) awkward. It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim. IIRC I finished it but had to cheat, or maybe gave up just before the end and watched the conclusion on youtube. If you skip all the book readings and narration (as I did) it will be an hour of hunting and pecking around the castle for objects and secret doors. Not too shabby really. [spoiler]I'd have never gotten to this if not for the save game file though, phew.[/spoiler]\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- I have only one point of criticism:\nThis game lacks a proper ending or epilog; something like The Witcher's Blood & Wine DLC. After adventuring hundreds of hours, after growing fond of and close to my companions, I got kicked so hard out of the game - it hurt!\nIn fact I immediately started a 2nd playthrough, because I wasn't yet ready to let go. Please Larian, give us an epilog or at least one last night at the camp with all my allies, companions and friends for the Definitive Edition.\n\nedit: As of patch5 this has been implemented. Thanks Larian Studios! You guys are the best!\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- Like Fallout 4 but with karma,\nAnd reputation\nand ammo types\nand interesting factions\nand without half the npcs being essential\nand with interesting characters\nand good dlc\nand interesting companions\nand interesting world\nand cazadors\nand with more than 2 types of shotguns\nand with unique weapons actually meaning something\nand immersion\nand the ability to actually make your character how you want\nand with good skills\nand starting SPECIAL skills meaning something\nAnd actually being a solid 10/10\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Your girlfriend might be temporary but DOOM is ETERNAL!\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- The EA anticheat successfully prevents players who aren't cheating from entering the game.\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- Death's Door - A Poem Review\n\nThere was a tale of a crow,\nWhose world was bleak and full of woe.\nUntil he stumbled across Death's Door,\nAnd realised after life there was much more.\n\nWith feathers preened, he began his quest.\nTo open this door he'd try his best.\nA sharpened beak and weapon in hand,\nHe ventured forth across the land.\n\nWhere first he came across a witch,\nWho really was an evil... hag.\nHer foes she turned into ceramic pots.\nAnd lives she ruined? It was truly lots.\n\nSecond was the King of all creeks.\nA giant frog with bigger butt cheeks.\nThough his armour was terribly tough,\nHis squishy rump wasn't hard enough!\n\nFinally was the beast on mountain top.\nWhose reign of destruction would this day stop.\nAn abominable creature, all hairy and sweaty.\nWho also went by the name of Betty.\n\nWith three souls collected, the Crow returned.\nTo his final goal with lessons learned.\nWhat more was left for him to explore?\nWell, you'll have to find out and play Death's Door.\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- Pretty alright for being free \nThe visuals are just so yucky tho.\nAlso I don’t understand why a match has to be 20 minutes long, that’s pretty insane and I wasn’t able to check out all the characters and their special abilities because it would take way too long. Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are. It's easier to notice it now in this edition of the game!\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- everyone posting 16 gb ram specs and saying it runs well, lul\n\ni have 8 gigs of ram with a gtx 660 (yep) and a fx-8350 and it runs around 45-60 FPS (i cap it at 60) at High settings. yeah. REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine.

Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- Great addition to the series. Adds just enough on to the original game's mechanics to justify itself. The length is a good bit shorter than the first but the price is reduced to completely make up for it. All around great buy if you enjoyed the first.\n- Very addictive and challenging\nAlthough the whole game is happening on the same map, with the same enemy and the same weapons, it has a lot of replayability trying and testing new builds and characters.\nMusic is good. After the first 10-20 hours, the music mod made it even better, so is highly recommended to use that mod, even from the beginning\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- I like to think of this game as what a Telltale game should have been.\nReal decisions that have real consequences. Allies who leave you due to the actions you take, betrayal due to dumb decisions. All of which only happen due to the choices you can make.\nBut instead of quicktime events, you play some games of Gwent.\nSome really difficult decisions as well, ones that i had to seriously stop and think about. A couple of stupidly easy ones as well, but i can forgive that.\nAlso some fantastic tongue in cheek references to other games/pop culture that i had some laugh out loud moments.\n\nYou also get to upgrade and customise your deck as you earn new cards along the way and they do that well. Save a <random character so as no spoiler> and convince him to journey with you? You know have access to his cool card (and trust me, there are some really cool cards). \nBut piss him off so he leaves, well his card is no longer available to you. I'm actually convinced ive missed a possible card or two due to some story decisions.\n\nIf there was one thing i think the game lacks, its risk.\nSome people have complained that its too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, which i think has some truth to it, but even that i dont think is the real problem.\nThe real problem is that if you lose a fight, it doesnt let you continue, you just retry till you win.\nSo if the game asks you, do you engage in a risky fight to save some of your trapped soldiers or do you leave them to their fate, you obviously would always choose the risky fight, as there is no punishment to losing the fight. You just keep retrying till you win.\nIt does take the weight away from a bunch of decisions and i also think it takes away that feeling if triumph you should get when you win the difficult fight and save the troops. You literally risked nothing.\nHowever, There are more than enough difficult decisions that have nothing to do with combat that you will still love this game.\nNot sure how they could fix this at this point, since the story is already fairly detailed with branching decisions.\nMaybe something to keep in mind for the next game. Give us fights that if we lose affect the story badly. Make it feel riskier for us to always choose the better path, so we are tempted to choose the easier one and therefore feel good when we succeed the  hard one, or feel the consequences when we fail the harder path.\n\nIs it worth the cost? I honestly think so, I haven't regret the money ive spent so far. Some people complaining its too short for what it costs (based on the 30 hour estimate, not them having actually played it), but for me its a really good quality 30 hours and i wish more games would take note.\nPeople complaining about 30 dollars for 30 hours are the reason Dragon Age Inquisition had 60 hours of useless grindy soul destroying fetch quests instead of being a streamlined, awesome game.\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- THIS GAME IS BORING PIZZA TOWER SHOULDVE WON I LOVE PIZZA TOWER\n\nCOCOON DEVS YOU WILL REGRET TAKING AWAY PIZZA TOWERS GAME AWARDS WIN TO ALL OF US GAMERS WE WANT PIZZA TOWER TO WIN GAME AWARDS NOW YOU WILL GO ON TWITTER YOU WILL REPLY TO EDMUND MCMILLEN AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING THE WIN AWAY FROM PIZZA TOWER AND MAYBE YOUR GAME WILL BE FUN!!!

That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- 5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- Since when I played Plants vs Zombies, years ago, I looked for its great soundtrack composer Laura Shigihara, finding her Twitter profile. She was talking about a game she was developing, named Rakuen or something like this, and the whole project sounded awesome. I promised to myself that I would buy it the day it was released.  \n\nTo be exact, I only got motivated to register a Steam account specifically in order to buy Rakuen, even if other games were bought before and after it.  Also, even if I found a blog and YouTube videos where Laura talked about Rakuen's development, I didn't read or watch any of it, to avoid creating wrong or misguided expectations. \n\nAnd it was worth the wait. This is an awesome piece of art.\n\nAs a story, Rakuen has a well developed and thoughtful plot, deep and diverse characters, balanced and pleasant pace. \n\nVisually, Rakuen has colorful and elegant graphics, with easily recognizable sprites and detailed scenarios.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid, with simple but entertaining puzzles, not too hard, not too easy, and with rock solid programming.\n\nFinally, Rakuen's music is delightful, perfectly syncronized with the feelings inspired by the plot.\n\nRakuen provoke chuckles, tears and smiles. It brings back a warmth sometimes we forget that exist. It became one of my favorite games ever, and I doubt its place will ever be taken by another title.\n\nThank you Laura, thank you very much for Rakuen.\n- This is a retro 2D pixel \"moon lander\" style physics puzzle game.  Move the little spaceship around the obstacle course using the thrusters to get to the target. \n\nReally low effort stuff, ugly retro pixel graphics, and a way inflated price for shovelware.  I can't recommend this one.\n- [H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1. You get access to the newly added levels, as well as elusive targets and most of the escalations. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman 3 Deluxe edition - a bit scammy, not quite worth the money, but it comes with some music, 3 new skins and a couple of extra escalations. This won't give you any new levels. This does not give you access to the 7 deadly sins levels.\n\nHitman trilogy - Comes with nearly everything. If you want to buy hitman and access most of the levels, this is the one to go for. I believe the only things you do not get access to are the sniper edition levels, the patient zero campaign, the deluxe stuff, the 7 deadly sins levels and any extra skins. This is like the core of the game without any extra things.\n\nHitman trilogy premium add-ons - literally just hitman trilogy except it includes the features that aren't in hitman trilogy. You have to own the original Hitman trilogy in order to buy this one. The only thing it doesn't include is the 7 deadly sins. If you are stupid and can't comprehend what I just said; it doesn't include the base levels. Only the extra stuff\n\nHitman - 7 deadly sins pack - the new 7 deadly sins pack. It includes the 7 new levels that are a bit simular to escalations. Basically, there are still 3 stages in each sin, (they are sorted as targets, so every time you eliminate a target, its like a checkpoint. So you can really count it as just 1 stage with 3 targets.)  Its basically escalations but with a lot of effort put into them.\n\nHitman 3 access passes - these are basically dlc's that were put in hitman 2 and 1. If you already own these, you should automatically gain access to them during the carryover. There is one called 'hitman 3 access pass: hitman 2 gold', this basically means 'if you are new to the hitman trilogy, you can have access to the dlc in hitman 2 here'. \n\n\nhere are what the access passes do:\n\nHitman 2 gold edition - it gives you access to all hitman 2 levels, which is why its so expensive. It comes with all levels, including the sniper editions, the expansion pack (2 places, Maldives and New York) as well as some extra skins. Its pretty big if you ask me\n\nHitman 2 standard - gives you access to standard hitman 2 locations. This is basically the gold edition but without sniper edition, the expansion pack or extra skins. It gives you access to the base levels. Which is miami, columbia, mumbai, whittleton creek and the isle of sgail\n\nHitman 1 GOTY edition - gives you access to every level from hitman 1 but without campaigns\n\nHitman 1 GOTY upgrade - gives access to the hitman 1 campaigns, does not include the base levels.\n\n\nMost of these packs are worth the money. But most of them are on sale quite often. So if you think some of them aren't worth the money, you can always wait a month or two and get a massive sale on it.\n\nthank me later\n\n- [h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading! Please leave a comment if you feel I have left anything of importance out or if you just want to share your thoughts. Cheers!\n- A really well-crafted piece of interactive media, that sets a very high bar for future video game \"making of\" projects. \n\nI had only vaguely heard of Karateka before, but nevertheless really enjoyed how this story was told. All the supporting documents, assets and (playable) prototypes are presented in a neat timeline, alongside the released games and remasters, with video interviews that tie it all together into a great story.\n\nIf you have an interest in video game history, solo video game development, or game publishing in the 1980s, do yourself a favor and check this out!\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- [i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- This is less of a review and more of me gushing about how much im enjoying myself, but you can still get a idea of what the game is from it. I am not usually a puzzle game player, or even a \"chill\" game player. im usually all about quick shooters, fighters, and platformers, but i decided to give this game a shot and i am very glad i did. with a mechanic as simple as pushing trees i thought that it would be simple enough for me to have a good time, the last time i played a puzzle game was BaBa is You and i put 14 hours into it and never got past word 3, it was just too much for me. but this game manages to still be challenging even with it laying all the pieces out in front of me, it introduces new features not by putting one in a level and saying good luck, it makes you do something you have done before but gives a new outcome, because you never got to do that thing in that exact way before, and when puzzles start requiring you to do those things you wonder how you ever got that far without doing one of those things before. all of the mechanics and solutions also are based in logic, all your doing is pushing things, so you dont have to suspend your current understanding of things to learn a new mechanic. The world of the game is also very relaxing and sucks me right in, its a museum of the \"past\" of humans that takes place in the far future from the perspective of monsters who dont really understand human culture, and it is hilarious! the music is very chill and moves with your actions, when you push something in a specific way the music also does a specific things, and its part of the reason this game is so relaxing. most other puzzle games i have played frustrate me when i get stuck on a puzzle for a long time, but seeing the monster relax helps me relax and keep a level head to get to the next museum exhibit. i dont know how to end this review but if you read it i hope you dont feel like i wasted your time!\n- Quite possibly the worst game ever.  The menus and navigation appear to have been designed to deliberately confuse the player.  At no point is there any guidance as to what the player should be doing.  Free roam is fun, but the driving physics are nonexistent.  \n\nInstruction comes in the form of a tiny text readout for a complicated step, and is never repeated or accessible.\n\nMost frustrating of all?  Its impossible to just simply quit the game without messing with the entire interface in a while goose chase for a way to exit the application.  I finally settled on ctrl-alt-del, but the game even withstood an end task and simply kept playing.  Had to hard boot my computer.\n\nTotal garbage.\n- My previous review reflected the terrible state of the game as it was on launch day. After years of improvements, the game has had its map design & cover placement tweaked, pretty-boy playermodels have been dirtied up, cringy voicelines were adjusted & a bunch of new content has been added. A lot of my complaints were addressed and I recognize the amount of work the team has done to bring the game back. It finally feels content complete and has reached an acceptable level of quality that should've been there when it came out.\n\nHowever, I am still disappointed to say it falls very short of its predecessors in terms of gameplay, map design and atmosphere. I see no reason to play this instead of BF3/BF4. \n\nPlay the map Grand Bazaar in Battlefield 3. Look at all of the particle effects, post processing and detail that map has. It has such a thick rainy atmosphere. Play it through to the end and you'll see how players tear up the map and make it look destroyed. In BF4's Paracel Storm, the foliage will sway & the waves will rise as the strong winds of a storm approaches the map. Watch as a sandstorm creeps up in Gulf of Oman and eventually engulfs it in a torrent of chaos. These landscapes have so much drama that the ones in 2042 lack. Sure, there are sandstorms and tornadoes, but they still look so sterile compared to the previous games this title stands upon.\n\nConceptually, 2042's world is supposed to be on its knees. The growing reality of extreme climate, natural disasters becoming commonplace and the world powers fighting over the last resources Earth has to offer depicts a dire situation to immerse ourselves in. This makes me imagine maps where earthquakes adjust the layout of flags throughout the round, or tsunamis roll in and what once was a playable area is now flooded. Giant tornado events that tear down skyscrapers. Sandstorms that turn the widest of maps into a close-quarters brawl. \n\nThe maps in the game have some aspects of this concept but nowhere to the amount that it should. The technology is there. The previous games have had a genuinely impressive level of immersion and atmosphere. 2042 did not have this on launch and it still doesn't. This could have been the wild natural disaster Battlefield game where we see SHTF.\n\nI don't care that we have 128 player matches or goofy butt specialists to play as. They missed the mark with 2042 and no update can fix that, conceptually, it never was able to realize its potential.\n- This is my Maifa Definitive edition review. As someone who has spent the last week of my life playing this game and 100% completing the game and all of its achievements, I feel like I can have an input on whether this game is worth a buy or not. \n\nFirstly I bought this game as part of the mafia trilogy bundle which at the time of buying it retailed for £49.99. As of writing this review I have not played the other 2 games so I cannot say if the bundle is worth it just yet. But that being said the first game is totally worth the £25 or so buying price. \n\nGame also played on Classic difficulty (the best one)\n\nThe Good -\nThe story and world -  (no spoilers) This is one of the better stories I have played for a long time and a lot of this  is due to the original game that came around in 2002. I was 2 years old so I have never really been aware of the game's story. The story, world and the characters are what I would say the game exelles at the most. The game had me chuckling at interactions between the characters and that is quite rare for me! The world is set in the 1920s era and it is amazing! Everything from the music, the cars, the suits, the guns are incredible. If you are like me and love a great story and some action and adventure. This game will hit the spot for you. \n\nThe combat - This is also one of the biggest enjoyment factors of the game for me. Each gun feels slightly unique with the way they shoot and the adjustment for recoil and how much damage each weapon does. Although the melee combat is one of the laziest I have seen in a long time. That being said, I had an absolutely horrific time with the controls with the mouse and keyboard. The combat was so frustrating at times and not being able to remap the keys to mouse buttons was extra irritating. So PLAY WITH A CONTROLLER. This makes the driving, combat and overall experience so more enjoyable.\n\nThe driving - This is something you do a LOT of in this game especially on classic difficulty. So again play with a controller because it can take some getting used to. Once you get the hang of it and understand the different mechanics like pressing A to nudge around corners. It makes for a cartoony yes but a very fun driving experience. You will feel yourself become the best driver in the city once you master it. \n\nThe missions itself - Again I won’t go into detail about the missions because if you are reading this you probably haven't played it yet. I just want to say that there are a good variety of missions that are interesting, whacky, strange, but also a great time. They offer a GTA like experience where you never quite know what's coming next. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad- \n\nOptimisation issues - Okay this is a big one indeed and I had many issues with the game throughout my playthrough. Firstly I meet the requirements and have installed my driver updates. So it was definitely the game. Now what I experienced were low FPS, stutters, the game got slightly chopped off when borderless. No crashes though sometimes the stutters got so bad I couldn't control my car, which is a big issue in a game you drive a lot. What I did do to eventually get it running pretty much flawlessly with no stutters was to play in windowed mode with v-sync on. I can't really give much more detail so hopefully this helps. Just make sure you meet the recommended specs and run it windowed. \n\nThe UI - This is personal preference honestly, some people might not care but I did. This was something I was able to change in the menu settings so it was fine. Things like having giant markers in the way where a 1 year old could figure out where to go. Enemies on the minimap which took the immersion out of knowing exactly where enemies were. Etc. \n\nControls for keyboard and mouse - This is something I was baffled by, they took no time in making sure every person who plays on a keyboard and mouse has a good time. The controls are awful and almost impossible to remap to how I would want them. So play with a CONTROLLER please. It is the best way.\n\nGame and story length - I think this review took almost as much time to write as the game lasted. It isn't awful, but I would have liked it to be longer for sure. It feels like they skipped thighs out and time just moves very fast. Overall I completed everything the game has to offer in 25 hours give or take. \n\nConclusion - If you enjoy action adventure games like I do with a great storyline and characters, set in this amazing world that Hangar 13 has recreated you will honestly enjoy the experience. As long as your pc doesn't have issues with it of course. My advice would be buy the game, try it make sure it runs okay then play it and enjoy it. If it doesn't refund it.\n\n- As someone who was disappointed by Deconstructeam's previous game, The Red Strings Club, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this immensely. Your choices actually matter this time (you can have multiple endings as opposed to one), the characters are compelling and fun to engage with, and it offers some much needed improvements on transgender rep (no more using someone's deadname in order to progress the plot). The art design is gorgeous, the gameplay is soothing, and the plot keeps my attention from start to finish (no more grinding to a screeching halt in the third act to make some phone calls). \n\nKeep in mind that the game does encourage more than one playthrough, so some players might not get a whole lot of enjoyment (it's slower paced and has a few missable achievement) but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I plan on coming back to reforge my fate with the Cosmic Wheel soon.\n- A classic horror game that it’s worth every cent. I can’t stress enough, you have to play it yourself. [i]Mad Father[/i] has this eerie atmosphere that will make you so addicted that you won’t stop playing until you’ve solved the great puzzle centered in your family roots. It's a story about love, hate, madness, the fear of death. [spoiler]And about a crazy daddy carrying a f*cking chainsaw and chasing you. After all, that's the best way to tell \"I love you\" to his 11 years old daughter.[/spoiler]\n\n∞/10.\n- I was hoping for a good game but I can't believe the positive reviews. Really annoying on a personal level. If you like your hand held and revel in 3rd person view then enjoy, but I think it's terrible. I was on the mountain jumping across a platform. \"Press ENTER\" to 'grab' it suggests. I press ENTER and what do you know? Nothing happens. Well, you die continually because what it tells you to do (zzzzz) doesn't work. Ah, maybe this is part of the 'difficulty'...hahahaha.\n\nNot a patch on any Far Cry or GTA even though these are full of directions. First Tomb Raider I've bought and definitely the last. What is it with games these days telling you what to do every step of the way: Do this...do that....go here....find item...take item...drop item...fire now.....pull lever...talk....rest....jump.... quit game and uninstall, ya that's the best option. As this game is created for a dumbed-down society or tailored for intellectually challenged meercats, some of us can see where the industry is heading. What happened to thinking for yourself???\n\nI don't need to progess far in this game because the first 10 minutes says enough. Do this, do that, blah blah blah...\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- [b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.\n- I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.\n- There is a lot to like here, but I don't recommend it.  I liked the concept and the fairly sophisticated and emotional story.  I also liked the humor and references that people in their 20s or 30s would find nostalgic.  What I did not like, was the disconnect between a story for people who understand such things, and game elements that were ridiculously childish.  It's not even really a game.  It's basically just a point-and-click interactive story, which is fine, except in my opinion the \"puzzle\" elements weren't at all puzzling, and the \"hunt for memories\" was basically just the game leading you around until you click a button to go to the next phase.  There is zero cognitive challenge.  This could have been so much better in terms of the satisfaction I would have felt for completing increasingly challenging game elements to get to the next segment of a story that I found very engaging.\n\nThe piano compositions and sound effects are fantastic.  Without the music, To The Moon loses much of its emotional gravitas, and I doubt so many people would enjoy it.  Played with muted speakers, it would be hard to justify its $10 price tag.  Fortunately I picked it up on sale, and I think I got my money's worth, but I wouldn't buy again and don't recommend it as a game.  It would make a decent novel or screenplay though.  Books and films don't crash a couple of times every hour.  Might only be a Mac 10.10.1 issue, but none of my other games do this.  Also, I completed the game and didn't get the achievement for doing so.  Don't tell me why or how to fix it.  I don't care.  Now that I've finished it, there's no reason to go back to it, unless I want to fall asleep to the soundtrack.\n- Wait. So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- Ah yes, the infamous Saturn Quest, the only 3 game series that has 3 fans and maybe 30 sold copies put together (I imagine it's not exact but very close). Part bullet hell, part space shooter, part boss rush, some platforming here and there, and even some puzzles with exploration - so take that intuitive game design. Once again I feel like I have to thank the developer for this rather personal gift, I take it personally because only a few of us still follow these games, and I imagine the dev is well aware of its lack of appeal. As with other Arkhouse games, I don't play them because they are good games, I am playing them for the experience, strange art, unique soundtrack, and just the world that I can't truly explain. \n\nI was just about to say that Arkhouse finally made a game with fair difficulty and learned from his mistakes - yep spoke too soon, it's a nightmare, a test of patience like it always is, 5 games back to back, shoving a hot ____ __ __ ___, absolute torture, no mercy, only illusion of hope and a false sense of security. I can just see myself from 3 years ago, yea Beetle, we have been through this before you know, stop acting like you're surprised. It started so relaxing though, almost self-aware of his mistakes in a way, even kinda playful which is not something that I usually get from these games, but yea, eventually the game ramps up the difficulty to what I consider a \"let me play something else\" tier. Actually, I will say the difficulty in this game is kinda more reasonable, but at the same time,  it's not any easier than the previous 2 just because some of the boss fights are so time-consuming, plus some of the space stages are just BS, they always are with this dev. \n\nYea, if you did not like Arkhouse games before, this probably won't change your mind, I just think the first half of this game is a lot more accessible, not as intense as some of the other entries, and I actually really like some of the interactions in the narrative (if you want to call it narrative, there is a little twist this time), it seems the developer is more aware of his tropes now, implementing them in a more enjoyable way. Overall, whenever this game changes the genre I feel like it has a better sense of direction and purpose, whereas in previous Saturn games it was done just for the \"hey, look at my artsy game\".\n\nI will say that there are individual parts of this game that are well above other games from this developer in terms of being mesmerizing with beautiful pixel art, plus the music this time is absolutely stellar which is a huge upgrade from the second game. The only nitpick I have is that a lot of bosses look similar now, I actually kinda liked the design in the first game a little more. There is a pretty cool twist on the combat system, you do not just dodge bullets and hump the bosses now, but you can also build turrets and other support structures, it's kind of a cool idea, but it also makes it more confusing at first.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n(+) I think there are moments in this game that would make it the best Arkhouse game in terms of visuals, music, atmosphere, and even how the game interacts with you, I actually think the world is a lot more playful this time around. It feels like the developer is a bit more self-aware, I always ***** about his game design, but it seems there is an \"attempt\" to use it to the game's advantage.\n\n(+) As with any game from this developer, you do get something a little different from your typical video game, and this game is no exception. It seems the developer believes he was at the height of his creative power, and I can see that. It's probably the most realized game in his collection, although it's probably not the most compelling story (I think Cube Gothic beats it slightly), there is a better sense of creative direction, and aside from a few unfair difficulty spikes, I think the game almost feels like a crazy art museum, more so than just another game.\n\n(+) I actually like how you handled the narrative this time, kinda committed to that Saturn Language joke, which worked for me personally, and I will tell you, I 100% understand those conversations and exactly what is being told - not really. I like all of the dev-to-player interactions with the hints, didn't expect much humor in this game after the first 2.\n\n(+) You know, I think that turret thing was a really cool idea and it builds upon the previous game, it just does not work that well in all situations, often making the boss fights very long, but I do like the added layer of complexity. \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\nHere let me copy/paste my feedback from the last 5 games. You know what, I am not doing it again, it is what it is, it will never change, stay toasty Arkhouse, you might be crazy ******, but I still can't live without you. Okay you know what, put a jump on a dedicated button, one day right, not today, and probably not next game. It's a joke I know you won't do it.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 8/10 (this is a diehard fan score okay, I am aware of my biased here, I like it personally, and I am sure most people will hate this game with a passion) [/b]\n\nIn the spirit of this game I will put my final thoughts in the only language this dev understands. Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro? Do-do-do-do-do. Ex-Do-Do-Do-Do. Pe-P-Pee. Ex Pe-P-Pee? Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro. Ex-ro-ro-ro?

Ex Pe-P-Pee? \n\n[code]Niche, obscure and underrated games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- New edit: The developers have made the steam workshop available, but as an Oceanic user I don't have direct access to the workshop and I can't upload mods. It seems to be only available to Chinese modders, much like the previous 3rd party software. The problem appears to be covered up and not solved.\n\nEdit: Modding capability is now available. The devs are using a 3rd part chinese workshop that we all hate (thanks devs), however you can use Nexus Mods instead. Simply go to the Tale of Immortal nexus page and download any mod, then add it into the local mod section provided in the mod category. Then you're good to go.\n\nBe aware that currently, from what I've seen, the IDs mods use are generated at mod creation and multiple mods have a chance of ID conflict (breaking the mod/s). So if you have problems this may be the reason.\n\n\nOfficial English translation is available. The devs have mentioned 90% is translated, but I believe it won't impact gameplay. Players who haven't launched the game before will be switched to English automatically.\n\nIf you have launched the game before you will have to do the following: in the main menu select 语言 and change 简体中文 to English (Alpha) and restart the game.\n\nFor my review: Having played the game, I can say it's both good and bad. It failed to meet my expectations but I still enjoyed the game and will recommend it. The art is fantastic. The combat is fun but lacking compared to other action & slash titles (there is a lot they could do with it). Quests aren't very clear and their incentives are bad making it hard to get invested. You don't get anything really unique or interesting from quests as far as I've played.\n\nProgression is the most disappointing part of the game. It's a mix of crafting, gathering and looting to acquire items that will either enable you to advance or give you a stronger stat-boost when you do advance. Every realm does the same thing, only requiring different items at the new area/s that open up for that realm. This is a shame. Progression is the area that has the most potential in this game and yet is the most tacked on part, mostly an afterthought.\n\nThe developers could've made each realm advancement unique, with different gameplay mechanics for each one that ties into the unique aspects of the area/realm they're in. This would be a fantastic way to give a sense of freshness to each area the player explores and make them engage more actively in said area rather than rushing through it as we do now.\n\nProgression could've been the strongest part of this game but they ended up making it the weakest. Again, it's a shame. I see so much potential that just isn't capitilised on. Overall this is an experience I'd recommend. But I'd only play it once in its current state.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. \"Stop Button Mashing\"! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work! Piss poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015. At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!\n- Don't go in expecting a Soulsborne game. \nYou don't get to customize your character.\nYou don't get to just use any weapon.\n\nThat doesn't mean it is bad. In fact, I think it's a brilliant move. FromSoft has set a narrative with this that makes for a -real- story to be told with the player, rather than AT the player like in other FromSoft titles.\n\nIf you are worried about Activision's name being on the label? Don't be. There are no microtransactions. There is no hurdles to make you pay more. You get the game, you own everything currently available for it.\nAll Activision was in charge of was creating the tutorials, and doing some QA testing.\n\nOptimization is great, as well.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to buy this game and support Fromsoft. Show Activision that singleplayer only games are alive and well. This is a gem.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- Fantastic party game, great for playing with a group of friends. The track building and weapons make for frenetic, chaotic, fun. Like Mario Kart but with the joy of building levels and traps like Ultimate Chicken Horse.\n- [u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]\n- trolley problem simulator where you can save the world by having your team of giant mechs slam dunk kaiju into lava\n- This is a game that should not exist. It is so niche that I struggle to understand how a company could have greenlit a project like this. But I'm very glad they did, because it is absolutely incredible.\n\nIt is a love letter to history, to writing, to stories, to culture. A gorgeously illustrated and scored, geekly researched slice of humanity, where the fate of the Universe is not at stake, where there are no cosmic heroes to save the day. What there are however, is a cast of profoundly human characters, shaped by where they came from, having to decide where they will go and what will become of their tiny, little piece of the world.\n- Saw a few youtube videos on this and decided to check it out.  Only played 30 min but here's my review from that. \n\nCustomization options are disappointing and boring. All of the character skins were white guys (and a possible vanilla Mexican). The option not to add other races at least to the Allied side is weird. As a gamer, when given the option for customization I expect to be able to create a character I at least somewhat feel represents me so I can get immersed (and don't even talk about 'historical accuracy'). They're also level locked for some reason. The uniforms are basic as they should be and you have a very limited weapon selection depending on the class you choose which is standard for these kinds of games. The character customization is very lacking and the only real reason I see it being there is to create DLC uniforms to buy. \n\nThe game itself seems like it's going in slow motion and maybe it's something people get used to after a while but I couldn't deal with it. The run is more like a speed walk and it feels like the soldier is considering being a conscientious objector with the amount of hesitation in aiming. Also everyone was kind just playing the game like Battlefield anyway.\n\nThis is probably a game that's more fun to play in a serious MilSim community.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.\n- Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game\n- After almost 300 hours in-game, I might be qualified to review this. I'll start by saying that Larian has really got something special here. I'm glad that the work is ongoing, but the progress is palpable. I've broken down my review into a couple sections to hopefully give you a better idea of what you can expect.\n\n1. Graphics\nBG3 has the best graphics in any CRPG I've played up until this point. The animations still need work, as there are a number of cutscenes where things and characters are misplaced. However, environments, spell effects, equipment, characters, etc., are all meticulously designed and you can rest assured that Larian has painstakingly made even the most inconsequential NPC stand out.\n\n2. Sound\nThe sound design is fantastic. Each spell and weapon attack has a unique sound. The ambient sounds are distinct with each area you are located in, as well as the soundtrack. The soundtrack, in general, is well composed. I could sit on the title screen and just listen to the opening song for a long time. The voice acting is fantastic, especially the narrator. The only issue that I've found with the sound is similar to that of graphical bugs: cutscenes need polish. Sometimes characters don't properly voice their lines when cued. If there is a large fight going on with many different effects at once, some new effects may not properly play either.\n\n3. Story\nNot a whole lot of tied up loose ends story-wise as of yet. However, the intro scene is phenomenal. Probably the best intro cutscene in just about any game I've played. From there, the story picks up on a grand scale, then drops you off in the  starting area. You then begin to pick up the pieces to figure out what is going on and how to best solve your little problem. The storyline so far as what's available in EA isn't overly complex, but the particularly enticing part about it is the number of other smaller plots and characters which lend to the main. Over the course of my playthrough, I've picked up several potential paths which could ultimately be taken probably closer to the midpoint of the finished game. \n\n4. Characters\nI'll keep this one brief, but I just want to take a second to say that all of the characters are very well fleshed out and distinct. Even simple NPC's have personalities which, for the most part, don't strike me as cookie cutter in any way. Care has been taken into writing seemingly each and every character, even many animals and corpses. Many actions you take have an effect on your party's opinion of you, but each character has different preferences. Some party members, however, are a tough to nail down as to what makes them happy, even after almost 300 hours. The personality differences between what is expressed through character dialogue and what changes their opinion of your character can feel a bit inconsistent.\n\n5. Combat\nThe combat is fun and rewarding. Each action you take feels as if it has a distinct impact on the battle. This is partially due to the aforementioned animation and sound effects, very punchy and flashy, lots of pretty colors. This is also thanks, in part, to the combat system adopted from 5th ed. D&D. The die rolls, while not visible during combat, add quite a bit of tension and strategy to a fight. You can't just fling cantrips and spells willy-nilly at random enemies and expect to come out on top (for the most part). The balancing is done well enough to allow for a fair fight, but one that doesn't hold your hand throughout and is rewarding when you win. The world design is also done so well that, anywhere a fight could possibly break out (you can attack/kill anyone), the environment lends a lot of variation and strategy to the fight. The enemies are also very smart, to the point where they will flank and take the high ground on you. Stay frosty!\n\n6. Exploration\nExpanding on the final point of the Combat section, the world design makes Faerun feel alive. There is usually something to find around every corner; exploration is very rewarding. Exploration is rewarded in a few different ways. You can get unique loot (while not necessarily as distinct as titles such as Elden Ring, there is a good variety of equipment to find), find interesting social encounters, or battles. Furthermore, battles can be turned to social encounters or vice versa. The versatility in how the player overcomes different situations is very well thought out. My main grip with the exploration is a personal one, but it's the map. It can get sort of tedious trying to navigate the world using the map. But, the exploration area is not particularly sprawling, so you won't be caught wandering around looking for a particular area for too long. A few important items for side quests also come to mind as being particularly hard to find, as they don't really stand out from the background. But, holding Left ALT will bring up titles for items lying around the area if you want to go that route.\n\n7. Races/Classes\nThe current races available are as follows: drow, human, githyanki, dwarf, elf, half elf, halfling, gnome, and tiefling. The classes are fighter, wizard, rogue, ranger, cleric, warlock, druid, sorcerer, warlock, and bard. Larian has done a good job distinguishing each race and class from one another, whether the customization options or progression. The only issue that I have is that the full PHB selection is not yet available. There are subraces available for each race, each with differing characteristics from another. The subclasses are all very self explanatory, if you are familiar with the 5th edition Player's Handbook. A few names had to be changed for certain things within classes, probably due to licensing issues. Also no multiclassing as of just yet. Curious to see if they decide to patch that one in.\n\n8. Character Creation (Visual)\nKind of simplistic at this point. There are no sliders which allow to you to sculpt the face or body, although there are a fair number of preset faces. A good number of hairstyles and facial hair options, as well as colors to apply. And yes, you can apply beards to female dwarves (lookin' at you, Rings of Power).\n\n9. Progression\nSimilar progression to 5e, except that there are several events which grant XP other than just slaying your enemies. Now comes the main problem I have with EA, the level cap. The world is very well designed and very dense, each action you take for the most part feels well rewarded with XP. But, a full playthrough of all the content could see you sitting at 4th level for several hours before completing. This is especially frustrating because 5th level is when you get your second attack and 3rd level spells. But the loot in the game still allows for a little more variety as it does continue to progress in power/utility even up until the end.\n\n10. Optimization\nI run this on a pretty mid-system (Ryzen 5, 1660ti, 16gb RAM) and I can hold between 50-60 fps when exploring on high settings. When in a busier fight, my fps ranges from 35-45 ish. There are a few bugs which impact functionality (dialogue not displaying during conversation, getting stuck on a character's turn during combat, random crashes, etc.). Luckily, these have all vastly reduced in frequency. While the gameplay is by no means flawless, it has reduced frequency enough to where it's not so bothersome as to ruin the game for me. Just depends on your bug tolerance. If you're a Bethesda fan, you'll be just fine.\n\nJust a final thought before I end this thing. If you just want to experience something different and don't mind playing a work in progress, this game is for you. Larian is fantastic at listening to user feedback for optimization to things as small as simple tooltips. If you want a full experience (and I 100% would not blame you if that were the case), just wait until it comes out. Hoping for early-mid '23.\n- No Man’s Sky is like a guy who owes you $1,000 from 6 years ago coming back with $10,000 to repay you after you thought the money was gone.\n\nI really like this game. I’ve been playing it for years on and off, returning after every major update to see the state of things. No man’s Sky might be a fantastic game now, but you gotta always remember how it all begun. When the game first came out it could best be described to had been as wide as the ocean, but having the depth of a puddle. \n\nThe game has improved so much from when it came out that it is easily one of my favorite space exploration games nowadays. One of the greatest redemption stories in video game history. It’s almost like they used the money they earned from sales  to actually improve the game. \n\nI love the idea of having this massive sandbox shared experience, where coincidentally anybody can stumble upon my little bases I scattered, mines, etc. I also love flying around the stars in my ship, discovering new planets, finding weird animals, plants, geography…\n\nThe sense of adventure and the thrill of finding some new world makes me have so much fun. If you like exploring and just taking your time  doing things, this game is a must, and I highly recommend it. \n\nThe truth is no matter what you think of the game we should all be grateful of what we’ve gotten. If No Man’s Sky was made by EA, all these updates throughout the years would probably have been released as $60 new games each.\n\nI’ll be honest, at this rate and with these devs I have a feeling No Man’s Sky has a better chance of of becoming what Star Citizen strives to be than Star Citizen.\n\nEvery now and then though, whenever I see a game trailer that I really enjoy, I like to remember the state of this game when it first came out and how awful it was. It keeps me in check and helps my expectations stay grounded.\n\n10/10\n- Stress: The videogame.\n\nBut in all seriousness, Isaac is an awesome roguelike game with infinite replayability. It's tough at first but as you get better at the game you will appreciate it more and more for the unique experience it provides. Every run feels different and even after getting close to 2k hours of playtime I still discover new things.\n\nAll DLC, and especially the latest of them - Repentance - introduce a ton of new content on top of the already existing one.\nThere are 34 characters in total, over 600 steam achievements and 3 save files to choose from.\n\nOn top of that, the game features a community workshop with countless great mods that add Quality of Life improvements and new features for every taste.\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes or are looking for a game with great replay value then I can wholeheartedly recommend Isaac to you.\n- A game that isnt afraid to be fun for the sake of it, a great game and one you dont see much anymore\n\nA great game to pick up after a long day of work, and you just want to hear some heavy rifts and kill some things.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- 9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\n- Great game, Horrible new publishers who stole the IP from the original creators. Do not support these thieves\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- One of my favorite Rockstar games to-date (next to Max Payne).\n\nThe negative review is for the awful DRM they've implemented, where you can't play SINGLE player if the Rockstar Launcher servers are offline.\n\nThe fact that there are people who pirated this game who can play it forever, while the people who payed for it are at the mercy of Rockstar and their DRM servers being online (for an offline game) is a joke.\n\nBuyer beware.\n- Wylde Flowers is a magical farming simulation. The spoken dialogue is wonderful and touches on difficult subjects, such as grief, estrangement from family members, and gender identity. The characters are diverse, have complex personalities and are really funny.\n\nThis game could be considered as Stardew Valley's even gayer little sibling. On a more serious note, it can be friendlier than Stardew Valley for first time or younger gamers, because of its simplicity, tightly told storyline (it is not an \"endless game\" as Stardew can be) and guided playthrough.\n\nIn my opinion, the game could be improved on a few fronts: character customization is one of them, and the fact that Tara, the main character, wears the same dress-leather jacket-chelsea boots millenial outfit during all seasons (including to bed, while sleeping over the covers) icks me profoundly. \n\nFinally, the pace of the game is a bit confusing to me, in the sense that it can be difficult to balance the storytelling aspect of the game with the more concrete tasks.\n\nAltogether, Wylde Flowers is a beautifully conceived game, filled with positivity, magic, a good soundtrack, and charming visuals.\n\n\n\n- So I'm going to assume that you've played CIV V in the past. Endless Legend's another 4x game like it, but in my opinion, it's so much better. And here's why:\n\n1) I know this is the advantage of being in a fantasy setting as opposed to the \"Real world\" (You get what I mean, I know Civ 5 isn't historically accurate, but it tries to stay in the world of realism), but all the factions feel genuinly different and exciting from one another. Both in style and aesthetics, the difference between Wild Walkers and Ardent Mages is far, far greater than say The Netherlands and Japan. \n\n2) I like the way that influence is a resource. I know it kinda takes the place of culture in that it's used for policies, but having to save up a resource that's more than just troops for wars and the like makes diplomacy far more meaningful, I find.\n\n3) The way strategic and luxury resources are done. Instead of \"This deposit has 8 iron\", it says \"This deposit has titanium\", and just gives you 1 per turn. It let's you build things that require a lot of that resource even if you only have 1 source, just slower than other people who have more. It makes a lot more sense to me. the fact that each luxury item is different from one another and have different effects is a lot more interesting than just giving +Happiness, and the booster system means that having 5 dye deposits (I wish) is more useful than it is in civ, where you have to desperatly try and peddle it off or it's a huge waste.\n\n4) This is a personal thing, but I like the fact that technology is seperated by era rather than previous tech. I find it a far nicer system to work with as it lets me get what I want when I want it, instead of having to research bloody sailing even though I'm completely land locked.\n\n 5)  I know this is locked away in Tempest, but naval warfare is so bloody interesting now. With ocean based citadels and bloody weather effects that you have to wrstle with, I've never been happier to play on ocean-heavy maps. The ocean's not just an awkward land, it's its own living breathing world. \n\n6) The living breathing world that is Auriga. The lore I'm uncovering from quests and gameplay is ridiculous, and it really brings the world to life. It makes me sympathise and despise each faction for their motives and executions, and I love it. Plus, I'm learning the more and more I play that this is Sci-Fi, not high fantasy. It's amazing.\n\n7) Minor Factions are a far better method of doing barbarian encampments and city states. They're a great blend of the two, spawning enemy units like barbs, and giving meaningful bonuses like city states. Plus, your opponents can't just take them over and use them as a base of operations against you.\n\n 8) I know this is a controversial one, but I love winter. 1-30 turns where I'm surviving rather than thriving? I'm amazed with how much I love the double edged sword of dread and gratitude depending on whether or not I'm being invaded at the time\n\n9) I love the region system. There's X regions, this is their shape and size, and there's one city for each. I think it makes placing cities a lot more important than in civ where you can fart them around all over the place, and I get a lot less worried about having my neighbours settle all over me (Like the bloody shoshone). Plus, I think it makes zooming out and gazing upon your empire more satisfying. They're something nice about having all those rough edges instead of clean hexagons. Losing a city means losing a huge chuck of territory, and taking a citygains a huge chunk. The wars I've been in have been far more exciting as a result.\n\n10) Populations gets you citizens, like in Civ. I like just yelling at them to make more cabinets, sell more cabinets, or research new and exciting cabinets rather than making them work tiles. The fact that all the tiles get worked on automatically fits into this, as does the fact that your 20 population city is probably going to take up a hell of a lot more space than 1 tile. The fact that you can actually expand cities is something I love\n\n11) The way wars are fought. it;s not just blankets of single units, but a few core armies with 6-8 units in each. It makes it a HECK of a lot quicker and cleaner, while still having a grand scale. The fact that you can hands on rather than auto is something that I like to do if the odds are against my favor, but I can think of a clever stretegy to turn the tide in my favour.\n\n12) The hero system is something I like far more than the great person system. Instead of getting four bloody musicians I can't do anything with until the bloody modern era, you just get heros who you can use as spies, governers or generals, each able to be upgraded into whatever you want them to be or do. It's a super nice system I find, as I can just always get exactly the hero I need when I need them, which leads me nicely onto...\n\n13) The marketplace system is one I like. \"Oh I have no adamantium and noone will trade it with me!\". Well little Billy, you don't just have to resort to war anymore, you can just buy some. At a high price so it shouldn't be your first option, but it's nice to always be able to get what you need. Plus you can play the stock market in case you want to play Offworld Trading Company while you play Endless Legend.It's a nice way to get extra troops and great people too.\n\n\ntl;dr: It's a good game.\n\nGet it.\n- The demo was a lot of fun and the early access launch game which is more of that  was a lot of fun big surprise!\n\nOverall I would really recommend this game if you loved or enjoyed games like Warstride Challenges, Neon White, Speedrunners From Hell and other games with a focus on very short concise levels that are made for speedrunning. I will say while it looks off in the trailers the gun controls pretty nicely in the game no complaints there for me with this style of game. \n\n\nWhat I liked\n\n-controls feel great and very fast, you always feel in control and everything including enemies are very visible and have extra outline to help highlight them when in hectic combat\n\n- most levels are just the right length to not feel like you complete them before you even start them but not tedious to retry to get a better ranking\n\n-much improved optimization and performance wise from the demo, even on my laptop not really made for gaming got a easy 100 fps if I put all settings on low\n\n-Ranking system is pretty cool, you get extra points if you kill enemies, head shot them for critical damage, if you never get hit etc and more and of course ranked on time. There is a separate ranking for total points so say for killing a lot of enemies and in a row and then a separate ranking just for times for levels\n\n- Enemy A.I seems improved form the demo and they try to roll out of the way of gunfire or go behind kinda cover from the environments at times.This isn't a big thing since your flying through levels super fast anyway but nice to see\n\n-Decent number of standard guns and they are fun to use without trivializing using telekinesis and vice versa\n\n-Some stages focus on a large arena to fight waves of enemies and others don't so feels like game has decent level variety/variety in obstacles in levels\n\n-okay variety of enemies to fight so far\n\n-kinda humorous the odd time and there are stupid items to pick up with telekinesis and use like a live rat, a toy hammer, giant tennis ball etc.\n\n- telekinesis feels very seamless fast and fun/easy to use in combat, chucking random objects at enemies its a lot of fun\n\n- most levels are open enough to allow multiple paths to get through levels and you can usually skip fighting some enemies if you want to only go for a faster time in most levels \n\n\n\nSome Suggestions/Issues I had\n\n-maybe I missed it but no instant retry button if I want to retry a level instantly but haven't died\n\n-boss difficulty kinda feels a bit all over the place although there is not much boss fights, first boss feels way too easy, second one was fun and maybe just right although maybe on the side of   too easy from not having enough health \n\n-the second last level in this launch early access version \"\"\"\"\"stealth\"\"\"\"\"\" feels far too long and far too hard and full of way too much elite enemies and then it even has a boss fight to do in it too in the level all in one go without ever stop moving! \n\n-just a note when I played the demo version before the last boss fight in that felt like it should have either been a level with just the enemies and then a second separate level with a arena for the  boss fight not both that you have to do in the one attempt in a bigger level just kinda tedious imo\n\n-music isn't bad here but it feels like there is very little music and the music that is there kinda blends together a lot\n\n-hopefully this game can develop a big following community and maybe get a level editor down the line!\n\n-feels like you go in the 2 second slow motion mode when getting a critical hit on a  enemy or breaking glass a good bit too much in levels.\n\n- would be nice down the line to get bonus challenge levels, shorter much more difficult ones like how NeonWhite and War stride Challenges have bonus levels \n\n- for replay value might be nice to have 3 unique goals for a level e.g beat the level in under 40 seconds, only kill a certain number of enemies, kill no enemies etc.This is kinda in the game but levels don't seem to have specific or unique extra goals its the same ones for every level.\n\n- not a complaint but maybe later add a grapple hook, grapple hooks are always fun in first person shooters!\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- probably the first game on steam with tags 'gore' and 'puzzle' :) \nand if gore and puzzles are your thing, you will enjoy this game..a lot :)\n- Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"\n- (If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.\n- I have not play for long, but know well enough this game deserves a mention. A side on, survival-ish game set in a war. Now, While I admire this game, it does have a few issues I personally find abnoxious.\nI'll start with those, and then will share what I like about it.\n\n-Characters you play seem to have never stolen anything at all from anyone, ever during the war. This is reflected in how unhappy and whiney they become caring more about the people they have taken from than their own wellbeing.\n\n-Characters you play are too softhearted. Just use the example with the point above. \n\n-Characters are expert carfters for being just average people. How many average people know how to pick locks, make servicable firearms and make alcoholic beverages? Well these three certain are capable of all three and more. For that matter, they all can do everything, but have one special skill they are the better at than the rest.\n\n-You get to only visit one building per night. This is bad since if you chose a building with other survivors in it, you will either need to steal from them to get supplies and be faced with a lot of unhappy complaining, or return home with nothing.\n\n-Visting other survivors, you cannot negotiate with them let alone talk to them. What you can do is beat them to death (or kill them with whatever weapon you happen to have on you at the time). I don't see how this was a good design choice at all when the characters you play are not personally that sort of people. Attacking other survivors is certain to cause problems with your characters.\n\n-You can not relocate from your starting place. What you start with is your base of operations.\n\n-Raids happen frequently to you only. You will never kill raiders, only chase them off and this happens behind the scenes, out of your control, while your character is out scavanging.\n\n-You can not sleep in shifts. If a person sleeps, they sleep the whole night.\n\n-Rediculous resource requirements. Some things require far too much, while others require far too little. \n\n-There is little to none interaction between your characters. No idle chatter between them. \n\n\nNow for the good points.\n-You play 3 characters to begin with, each having one specialty. They somewhat have different personalities.\n\n-The art style appeals to me.\n\n-Characters are well animated. Different staes of tiredness, different things they do when unhappy or when they have nothing else to do.\n\n-The overall idea, even though it isn't implemented well enough.\n\n-Building your shelter from ground up.\n\n-Forgaing and stealth play.\n\n\nSo while i find some issues with this game's design, if you ignore the lack of realism and consider this to be just a game with a very narrow play style, it is quite fine. It has a certain atmosphere you generally don't find elsewhere. I still recommend to give it a try.\n- \"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo. How about not some random boring braindead splatterfest like this crap? Apparently a good lot of people actually have a need filled with this random gore generator. Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n\n【グループB】\n- No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft\n- Pretty fun and polished for a fast paced shooter.\nOn the technical side, the game ran well and I encountered very few bugs: in a few cases I got stuck in the level geometry, but then a failsafe teleported me back to a safe spot after a few seconds, and in another case I got softlocked by a broken level trigger but reloading the last checkpoint fixed it.\nAll the weapons are fairly useful and interesting, and they can be combined in creative ways instead of the extremely boring \"use A on B\" seen in Doom Eternal.\nEnemy variety is pretty good, even the lowest tiers are different enough to require a bit of attention.\nThe levels also aren't bad, but you have so much mobility that it's easy to sequence break by accident and in some cases skip past large chunks of them.\nSecrets aren't terrible, no wall humping required in this game, but given the sheer size of most levels they can be pretty tedious to find even when no attempt is made to hide them: in some cases, the opposite is true and you'll just walk into a \"secret\" by looking to your side as you follow the intended path.\nDifficulty is odd: I was playing on Street Cleaner (the middle of the 5 difficulty levels), and around the halfway point the game went from \"very easy\" to \"very hard\", with plenty of attacks dealing 300+ damage when the most you can stack is 200 health and 200 armor.\nAt least, the augments you collect in-game and the mutators you unlock by finding secrets offer plenty of ways to fine-tune the difficulty level: for example, you can enable infinite ammo and instagib to breeze through even the hardest difficulty, or disable all weapons but your chainsaw leg and triple enemy spawns to turn even the easiest difficulty into a bit of a challenge.\nFinally, there's a level editor and that's always nice.\n\nWorth playing, even at full price.\n- This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n\n- It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.\n- Look, I love Magic. It's my favorite game of all time. I met my wife through MTG. I'll be playing it until the day I die.\n\nBut if you're new to the game, and not established on Arena, don't pick it up. It's horrendously difficult to build a collection in this game, doubly so if you're not a fan of playing draft. While they have made incredibly minor adjustments that have been generally positive, the economy on this platform is impossible to do well in. The sheer number of games you have to play to amass any kind of respectable, and more importantly, functional collection of cards is not worth it for just a casual player.\n\nOf course, you can circumvent the grind with money, but that of course is the literal definition of Pay 2 Win. It's a mobile game economy through and through.\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- + The amount of stuff to grab and to do, insane\n+ New engine blows the old Isaac out of the water (fire effects, shadows, etc.)\n+ Game is amazingly smooth and clean\n+ Too many achievements to count for\n+ Too many hours spent in perspective\n+ Best poop simulator EVER!\n\n- Incompatible with social life outside the PC.\n- UPDATE: Had the music on the \"+\" but moved it here. Sounded incredible on the first run but on the long run it's kinda grating. Makes me miss Danny's amazing soundtrack.\n- TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.\n\nAn alternate title for this game could be \"Zen and the Art of Logistics\".\n- Cassette Beasts: it's high time we dispel the notion that it's merely a Pokémon clone. Developed by Bytten Studio, this game offers a fresh and exhilarating take on the monster taming genre that stands tall on its own merits. Here, we'll dive into what makes Cassette Beasts so unique and why it's a complete masterpiece.\n\nA Unique Twist on Monster Taming:\nAt first glance, some may draw parallels between Cassette Beasts and the Pokémon franchise. After all, both involve capturing and battling creatures, but Cassette Beasts distinguishes itself with its innovative \"cassette\" mechanic. Unlike Pokémon, where you simply capture creatures, in Cassette Beasts, you capture abilities and splice them together to create your own unique monster hybrids. This adds a layer of strategy and creativity that sets it apart from the traditional monster taming formula.\n\nA Riveting and Fast-Paced Story:\nOne of Cassette Beasts' most outstanding features is its gripping storyline. From the moment you step into this pixel-art world, you'll find yourself engrossed in a narrative that unfolds at a breakneck pace. The plot is full of unexpected twists, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes that keep you invested from start to finish. It's not just about capturing monsters; it's about uncovering the mysteries of the world and your character's place in it.\n\nChallenge for the Experienced Gamer:\nCassette Beasts doesn't hold your hand. It offers a refreshing challenge for those seeking a more demanding gaming experience. Battles are strategic and require careful planning. The variety of cassette combinations and the dynamic AI make each encounter a thrilling puzzle to solve. It's a game that rewards skill and strategy, keeping even seasoned gamers on their toes.\n\nVisually Stunning Graphics:\nThe game's pixel-art style is a work of art in itself. The attention to detail in every environment, creature design, and character is astounding. Cassette Beasts manages to evoke a sense of nostalgia while still pushing the boundaries of what pixel art can achieve. It's a visual treat that enhances the overall immersion in the game.\n\nA Masterpiece in the Monster Taming Genre:\nIn summary, Cassette Beasts is nothing short of a masterpiece in the monster taming genre. It successfully distances itself from the Pokémon comparisons with its innovative mechanics, and it offers a captivating story, challenging gameplay, and stunning visuals that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWhile Pokémon may have laid the foundation for monster taming games, Cassette Beasts takes bold steps in its own direction. Bytten Studio's creation deserves recognition for its dedication to delivering an unforgettable gaming experience that stands tall on its own. Cassette Beasts is more than a clone; it's a genre-defining title that has undoubtedly earned its place among gaming greats.\n\n10/10\n- Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.\n- I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^\n- tl;dr: if you're looking for \"Terraria in space\", buy Starbound. Don't waste 88 hours of your life like I did trying to find the game in this steaming pile of crap.\n\nIt's like Starbound or Terraria! Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.\n\nNow including:\n-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago\n-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have\n-Weapons that all feel the same\n-Confusing progression\n-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)\n-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)\n-Stupid glitches abound\n\nThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.\n1/10.\n- I finished the game on keyboard and had some pretty good fun with it.\n\nno way in hell am i going to try and S-rank all the levels, though.\n\nEDIT: this morning I woke up and thought \"well i'll only try to S-rank level 1 and then i'll put it down\", so that's the story of how i S-ranked every level in the game.\n- I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3\n- (UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.\n- SUPER MARIO!......\nsorry  not really :P\nits a platform game yes but nothing like mario\nyou can spend a lot of time in this game and still not master it\nthis is a game thats really good for platform gamers that gt to goodfor mario games\nand a punisher for those who are nt that good in those types of games \nit has lots of humor ad moments that will want to eat yoer fingernaisl to the bones\ni say hell yeah to this game even do it got me mad a few times\n- Very fun game. Best wave shooter on the market that I've ever seen. The roguelike nature of it is very fun. Each run hits you with different challenges in building your weapons.\n\nBiggest critiques - \n1. Achievements locked behind multiplayer in a dead game. God I hate when devs do this. It luckily lets you play through normal mode when queuing, but its still very annoying. The last achievement I needed was \"get to wave 50 of multiplayer gauntlet mode\". I've so far been able to play 2 games of multiplayer. One, my partner had no voice coms. Second, my partner started with extremely staticy voice coms and it cut out at about wave 5. We pushed through to wave 48. Aaaaaaaaaand network error. It took about an hour and a half to get that far just for the game to crash and lose it all. Devs, please stop hiding achievements behind multiplayer when you know full well your game won't have a huge online player base.\n\n2. You get TWO GUN ARMS! This is AMAZING AND AWESOME! Except for the fact that a ton of the attachments for your weapons affect every part on your gun. So by not just making one super mega death arm, you are effectively chopping your total strength into two parts. There are a few pieces that only give you buffs for \"dual wielding\" or having a firing barrel on each arm. But these are not very common, and the stats you get from them pale in comparison to just making a super gun on one arm and keeping the other arm clenched for punching enemies that get up to your face, or putting on a single melee weapon on the other hand for the same purpose. \n\n3. The variety of guns is fun, but in the end it ends up turning into \"hold the fire button, aim for enemies, walk in a circle to trick enemy aim as best as possible, and occasionally punch an enemy that gets to you\". The biggest change to this system is getting either the rocket launcher or the Barrel Barrel which shoots massive barrels at the enemies. They have a very slow fire rate and do best when aiming the shots more precisely. But even then, with some weapons having a spooling time, and others outputting a hale of bullets, the best strategy is to just keep the trigger held 24/7 and strafe your aim from enemy to enemy.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, but don't try to 100% it. The multiplayer achievement isn't worth it. Network is terrible. There's too much going on on screen when you have 2 players in the mix so crashing is likely. If I were the Completionist I would give this game a rating of Finish It. Play through the game with all the unique starting bonuses, all the difficulties. But stay away from multiplayer unless you have a friend to dedicate multiple hours to trying the gauntlet with.\n- In my personal opinion,Total War Warhammer 3 is better than its predecessor in every way.\n\nFactions:\nThey did an excellent job t fine tuning the older factions to the point where every faction now feels fully fleshed out and playable. The starting units are fun and the starting areas are usually in a better position. Sure, some factions start off in a really awkward ass places with really strong armies surrounding them, but overall, everything feels much more thought out.\n\nThe new factions they added to this game are fun altho for someone who might be just getting into the game, id recommend going with someone like Grand Cathay and move on from there.\n\nMap:\nThe world map is huge and i love it. The battle fields you fight in are detailed and look absolutely stunning. Fights look like movies sometimes so grab some popcorn and watch your armies die since you were munching on popcorn and not moving your units.\n\nRTS:\nthe RTS side of this game is what got the biggest improvement in my opinion. Everything is so much more clear and the battles just look insanely good. The game feels a bit more fast phase which i don't mind at all since WH2 felt like a battle of attrition sometimes and missile infantry seemed really bad.\n\nOverall i can safely say this i my favorite game currently. The multiplayer is super fun but judging by the reviews some of you leave on this game, its safe to say you have no friends to play with. \n\nDLC might cost bit more than it used to but people will complain about anything if its not free.\n- I don't usually give negative reviews on games, but holy shit. The map is not even done and you can go outside the \"map\" so damn easy. You randomly go back to the main menu without any reason.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- Pros:\nGreat movement/mechanics\nEasy to pickup, really hard to master. \nSoundtrack is 10/10. \nVoice actors are high quality, \nNeon Red. \n\nCons: \nyou need an acquired taste of deep fried cringe to get through some of the dialogue\n- Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny! From origins to Shadowkeep (Timeline and Lore explained)) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mbDXvDNqTU (Lore is one of the things that this game can be so frustratingly about - all of these other stories are so good but really hidden from the player, either because you missed them or they're not properly told to you in-game)\n- They added \"Precision\" mode for the mouse under controls, which is pretty much raw mouse movement. YAY!\n\nAnyway, one of my favorite games of all time easily at this point. Incredible story, fun combat, and awesome world. A must play for sure, especially if you've never played it before on Play-Station (like me). It also has a New Game Plus mode that unlocks different NG+ only armor that are insane.\n\nI played at normal, and aside from the Valkyries the other bosses are a cakewalk. Maybe play on hard or hardest.\n- As much as I adore this game's visuals, soundtrack, story, and... THE MEMES... I unfortunately can't recommend actually playing it.\n\nI can parry bosses in Dark Souls or Elden Ring with less frustration than in this game. The parry system requires you to execute a light attack towards an enemy right before they go in for a hit against you, which is usually telegraphed with a red glare in their eye. Unfortunately, even while using the lock-on camera (and by the way, you are never directly informed of its existence), half of the time my opponent was partially, or even completely off-screen. This is a problem, not only because it makes seeing an incoming attack difficult, but also because movement is tied directly to the parry system. You must execute an attack TOWARDS the enemy. With the camera having a seizure every five seconds, this makes it even more irritatingly difficult to aim your parries. I died to Blade Wolf repeatedly, not because of my own skill, but because midway through an incoming attack, the camera would decide to turn 90 degrees to the left, causing my movement to also shift to the left, nullifying my parry. \nIt's consistently inconsistent.\n\nIf there is some system in place that actually does help explain a lot of these game mechanics, fantastic. However, I find it inexcusable that whatever I might be missing would be so out of the way that I'd never encounter it unless I went out of my way to do so.\n- Edit 2 (9/24/22): The devs have made several updates now to address some of the UI problems. And right now, the in battle experience is greatly improved, especially when not using a mouse. It's good enough that I'm having fun playing it now, and am looking forward to seeing more of it so I'm reversing the thumb on this review. However, the experience remains decidedly clunky, especially with a mouse and especially out of combat. Overall, to anyone who is expecting a modern game with modern usability and controls, this game is not for you. But if you don't mind those things so much, this game has some real meat on its bones. It also has delightful music and sound. I'm leaving the original review here, as I hope the devs will continue to improve on the usability of the game so that everyone can enjoy it fully. If you're playing on keyboard and mouse, I'd recommend using the option that disables the mouse, the jank doesn't feel as bad when you're not clicking\n\nEdit: The devs have taken this feedback very seriously, I'm keeping a close eye on this game to see when things change so I can give this game another go.\n\nAgh... I really want to like this game. The customization and squad building seems like it will get really cool in the later parts of the game. But I don't think I'm going to make it to the later parts of the game. Why? Because the UI and controls are so frustrating. Camera movement is frustrating, selecting units is frustrating, distinguishing between your units is difficult, managing your squads is frustrating, promoting your characters is confusing, even attacking is a pain in the butt. Every time I go to do anything there's always some interface or controls issue in my way. And every time I finish a map and have to go do the in-between battles management, I know the UI will fight me every step of the way. \n\nMy thoughts on what should change:\n\nOut of battle:\n- On the \"Organize Army\" screen, I shouldn't need to click \"Squad Operations\" first to look at a squad. Simply clicking a squad should do that.\n- When returning to \"Organize Army\" from a squads view, \"Squad Operations\" is deselected, and has to be clicked again.\n- It is not possible to scroll the squad list without clicking \"Squad Operations\"\n- When I am in one mode on the squad screen (say \"Move Unit\") I can't switch to another mode by clicking the appropriate button, I have to cancel first.\n- When changing classes, there is not a clear enough indicator on the version of the unit I need to click that shows it has an upgrade available.\n- When changing classes, an extra click is required for no reason (and with no UI indication) before the upgrade options are viewable.\n- When changing classes, it should be easier to see what the next tier options will be for that class.\n- There should be a way to quickly view and either upgrade or sleep for a year all units who have class mastery between battles, so I don't have to check every squad.\n- From the Organize Army screen, there is no way to see a squad's capacity, so you have to click into every squad to see if you can add another unit.\n- When equipping an artifact, the first empty slot should be selected automatically.\n- When equipping an artifact, if I click the item first and then the slot, that should work. Drag and drop would be nice too.\n- On unit details screens (such as Unit Status or Change Class) there should be derived stats, that let me see how much damage the unit does / resists. As is, it's hard to tell what my stats are doing for me.\n- Unit traits should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click the name or icon, I shouldn't need to go to another page for that.\n- Affinities should show a tooltip saying what they do when you hover or click them, I shouldn't have to go all the way to the game manual for that.\n- When using an item, I should be able to see my list of items before selecting which unit I want to use it on.\n- When using an item, an extra click is needed before you can select the item, for no reason.\n- There should be a better visual indicator on the squad screen of who the squad leader is.[strike]Right now Jules looks identical to the archers on either side of him.[/strike]\n- In the marketplace, if I've clicked on \"Recruit\", and want to switch to buying items, I should be able to click direclty on \"Trader\" and vice-versa, without needing to cancel first.\n- When recruiting units, there should be a way to lock a units stats in place so I can look at their traits without accidentally mousing over another units name and switching it.\n- There should be a way to see what the deploy limit for the upcoming battle is, so I can organize my squads appropriately, without needing to go back to the battle prep screen after seeing it.\n- The mouse scroll wheel doesn't work on the game manual / tutorial pages\n\nIn Battle:\n- There should be a way to move the camera with the keyboard without moving the targeting cursor (this is necessary if I want to move the camera while still having my hand on the mouse)\n- It should be possible to move the camera with the mouse by left-click dragging, instead of having to bring the mouse near the edge of the screen (this is especially vital in windowed mode)\n- There should be a toggle to turn off the need to select \"Move\" for moving units on capture points\n- There should be a toggle to allow the turn to end automatically when all squads have taken their turn.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to end the turn.[/strike] (There isn't, but double-tapping space is close to good enough)\n- There should be a hotkey to display the mission info, and the mission info should appear automatically at the start of a map.\n[strike]There should be a hotkey to move to the next unit whose turn is still available, so I don't always have to scan the screen visually for this.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a units health (% of units alive, maybe?) and morale at a glance from the battle map. It takes so much time to dig out morale information for each unit by clicking all the way into their unit details.\n[strike]When you hover a unit, their morale needs to appear in the little mini-squad-view that pops up.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to see a tooltip explaining what a piece of terrain does.\n[strike]There should be a way to make an enemy unit's attack range stay visible on the screen so I can plan around it. Ideally, I'd be able to have multiple units selected for this at once, and be able to highlight them in different colors.[/strike]\n- There should be a way to quickly distinguish between squads led by the same unit type at a glance, especially when both squads are led by main characters. [strike]Right now Jules' squad and Narima's squad are identical visually.[/strike]\n- During combat, there should be a clear indicator of which unit is the squad leader.\n- After selecting an attack type, and a squad to target, on the screen that shows the two squads, there should be buttons I can use to change my attack type (such as switching to \"Force Surrender\" after seeing the enemy's morale is low).\n[strike]If I back out of an attack, I should be able to change attack type, or which action I do without the unit undoing their entire turn and deselecting themselves[/strike]\n- On the list of attack types, \"Force Surrender\" should have an indicator of what the surrender chance is, so I don't have to keep checking it.\n- It should be easier to tell at a glance if a unit has ranged attacks. Especially, some of the icons for cavalry ranged units are hard to identify.\n[strike]When moving units, it would be nice to have a visual indicator for units I can do a charge or ambush attack against[/strike]\n\nGeneral:\n- There need to be better resolution settings. Almost every piece of text in the game is difficult to read on a high resolution monitor.\n- The game needs rebindable controls, it's an accessibility issue.\n\nIf the game sees improvement in this area, I hope to be able to give it another chance and change my review.\n- Holy crap.\n\nPowerful.\n\nThis game explores some serious life issues: Abuse. The pain of childhood, and of parenthood. Manhood and womanhood. Strength. Loss.\n\nThis game had me near crying at several points. The story is freaking powerful. It's also remarkably well written, and downright hilarious at times. \n\nAnd the gameplay? \n\nIt's fun enough that I want to play through it again right after beating it. This turn-based RPG is sometimes brutally difficult, in part because it slaps many old-school conventions in the face (e.g., sleeping can be dangerous). Battles are challenging. Tactical thinking is essential since many enemies are VERY dangerous and you're frequently outnumbered. I really applaud the AI as it keeps you on your toes. \n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. There is no map, compass, or any attempt to make navigation easier. You just have to remember your way around, though there are plenty of memorable environments. \n\nCharacters will force you to make decisions with lasting consequences. There are dozens of hard choices to make along the journey, which brings me to another topic the game explores: decision. Will you save your friends, or your stuff? I got very attached to the buddies I picked up, only to have them devoured by a mutant, or bail on me when I least expected it. You just never know what you'll face, nor what to choose. Thinking back to many of those times, I don't know what I should have done. All the options sucked. \n\nBut I can't help asking myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" \n\nHighly recommended.\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- Got this game on launch, never expecting that I would become addicted looking at a stickman beat the living hell out of other stick figures. A lot of cool Easter eggs to find in the game (funny mini games, cool achievements etc.), great music, incredibly fluent and exciting while only playing with the mouse. Got a few dollars to spare? Snatch up this game and you won’t be disappointed. The only thing I’m disappointed in are my own reflexes, as I’m currently stuck in a few levels that are just way to hard for my taste. But a true ninja never quits trying. \n\nI never played part one, which is a mistake I’ll correct soon as well.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- This game vs. HOI3:\n---------------------\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.) The production system is more interesting and engaging, and far more balanced than the old IC system of HOI3. \n2.) The unit creation system is far more in depth and interesting, featuring many different brigade types and support companies, allowing you to change your divisions however you would like. \n3.) This game is far more stable than HOI3.\n4.) This game is updated regularly and has bugfixes regularly too, with content being added free along with every DLC. \n5.) The modding community of HOI4 is far larger with excellent mods such as Kaiserreich, Millenium Dawn, Red World, and Endseig.\n6.) HOI4 muliplayer is actually playable without making you want to shoot yourself.\n7.) China is no longer something Japan can take within 2 months.\n8.) An actual peace conference system and ideologies that actually impact the game.\n9.) Far easier to get into than HOI3.\n10.) Less railroading and the AI wont spaz if you do something ahistorical.\n11.) Planes are no longer as cancer as they used to be.\n12.) Far less micromanagement if you choose not to want to micro.\n13.) A better tutorial (still not a great one though.)\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.) The research system is bare bones in comparison to HOI3.\n2.) The War in the Pacific is basically nonexistant and naval warfare is awful (to be improved with next patch, being released eventually:tm:)\n3.) People dont really join the war in HOI4 unless theyre directly attacked, making continents like South America completely useless due to the fact that none of the countries there ever do anything but still build up their military, contributing lag.\n4.) Due to the game's engine, it can only use a single one of your processing cores, meaning regardless of your computer quality the game will run kinda slowly.\n5.) Speaking of slowly, the game is poorly optimized and frame loss is extremely common, especially 1942 onwards, when majors can have upwards of 300+ divisions. \n6.) The AI is often braindead, doing hilariously incompetent things such as charging endlessly into your lines, removing all its troops from your front, leaving major areas completely undefended, and completely ignoring the aerial aspect of the war.\n7.) Specific AI are even more braindead than the rest, specifically island nations, or nations that otherwise need to use navies and airforces more. Yes, the Japanese, American, and British AI are some of the worst in the game. In a WW2 game. \n8.) Your allies are completely useless and often you will find yourself doing all the fighting yourself, or even being hindered by your own allies. Playing as Germany the Italians likely wont place a single division in North Africa. In D-Day, you will either be the only one contributing anything or your allies will contribute so much that the supply is ruined and your troops all die of attrition. As the USSR you will recieve 0 lend lease, and as China you will get absolutely no support from the west. \n9.) HOI3 is a lot cheaper than HOI4\n\n\nOther things which I feel are worth mentioning but arent really advantages or disadvantages:\n\n1.) HOI4 contains a lot more alt-history options, which while not for everyone, are fun to try out. \n2.) The focus-tree system is something completely different from anything in HOI3.\n3.) The game has a less in-depth OOB(Order of Battle), which while to some people is nice because theyre bad with OOB, others dislike. Specifically this game lacks corps. \n4.) The battle-planning system of HOI4, while easier to use than the one in HOI3, is still flawwed. In HOI3 it did absolutely nothing, but in this game it is a core part of playing. Unless you want to mircomanage every single division, like you did in HOI3, you will use this system. \n5.) While simpler, the game still possesses a learning curve.\n\n------------------------\n\nOverall: \n\nHOI4 is a far less grounded and historical experience than HOI3. Is this a good or bad thing? That depends on your perspective. HOI4 obviously has significant advantages over HOI3 in certain areas but many consider HOI3 to be an overall better game. Personally I recommend HOI3 if you want a more micro-intensive, historical experience, and HOI4 if you want to just sit back and relax for a couple hours murdering millions of people. \n\nPersonally I would suggest either game, but thats just me.\n- Despite it's lack of official content and the dullness of the career mode, partly due to the sloppy AI, Assetto Corsa is simply the best racing sim ever developed. Everything smells the love of cars, from its jaw breaking physics to the amazing graphics, and just that feel of the car. A new benchmark for racing sims.\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- At a first glance I thought I would hate [b]Human Fall Flat[/b]. \n“Oh, this is another one of those wonky psychics ragdoll games that are obnoxiously hard to control,” I thought. \n...\nAfter playing it, I can now confidently say that my first impression was spot on. The only surprise was how much I enjoyed playing it. \n \n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I can’t fully explain why but I found Human Fall Flat charming. The “human” is adorably simplistic and can complete daunting tasks despite only being able to jump and grab onto things. It reminds me of a very energetic toddler, especially when you raise your arms and jump - [b]it’s so cute[/b]. Something about an awkward “human” taking on challenges makes me feel warm inside [i](is it weird that I feel like I’m watching a baby grow up?)[/i]. \n[*]The levels gradually get larger and the puzzles more complex. I find that this works well with the awkward movements of your character, as you progressively learn how to better control him/her. It’s almost as if you start off as a clumsy baby, learning how to move and perform simple tasks, and end up as an awkward adult, still clumsy but expected to complete harder tasks. \n[*]I’m impressed at how many interactable objects are included in this game. Paired with a pretty good physics engine and you can really have a blast. Swing on a vine like Tarzan? Why not. Row a boat? Sure. Shoot yourself out of a catapult? No one’s stopping you.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Neutral:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It’s not always clear what you are expected to do, but I guess that’s kind of the point of Human Fall Flat? From what I could tell, you can get past the obstacles in whatever way you like. Sure, there’s the intended way, but if you want you can just climb over things and rush to the end of the level. Or you can just fool around to your heart’s content. It’s essentially one big playground with a goal at the end. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It can be frustrating when things don’t go as you expect. Since your character has the structural rigidity of jelly, you’re constantly battling the floppiness of your character. My advice is: don’t expect to move with precision and you’ll have a good time. I also encountered a few bugs, like my arms or legs getting stuck in an object. Luckily there are many checkpoints and it’s relatively quick to reload.\n[/list]\n \n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]★★★✬☆ Surprisingly fun[/h1]\nI was honestly surprised at how much fun I had playing Human Fall Flat. I tend to avoid ragdoll/physics-y games - Getting Over It, for example, looks like an absolute nightmare to me - but I don’t regret playing Human Fall Flat at all. \nHuman Fall Flat is an absolute blast if you don’t take it too seriously or just like goofing around. I wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer serious games, as it’s very likely that you will just end up getting frustrated. The choice is entirely yours. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url]. Your time and support is greatly appreciated![/h1][/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- Good game that flips the p2w/f2p mobile ideas on its head, and succeeds. It's totally free to play, and actually encourages playing to improve over buying. Other mobile developers should take notice. Especially if it still makes money through Season Pass and cosmetics. I'm buying a few passes just to support their f2p model.\nIt also helps that the game is fun and addicting. There's always a 'one more game' feel...\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- On January 9th,  without warning, explanation, or justification, and lacking all sense of logic, Capcom forcefully reset customizable ingame key-binds and removed the ability to rebind them. These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- Like Fallout 4 but with karma,\nAnd reputation\nand ammo types\nand interesting factions\nand without half the npcs being essential\nand with interesting characters\nand good dlc\nand interesting companions\nand interesting world\nand cazadors\nand with more than 2 types of shotguns\nand with unique weapons actually meaning something\nand immersion\nand the ability to actually make your character how you want\nand with good skills\nand starting SPECIAL skills meaning something\nAnd actually being a solid 10/10\n- Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- I have mixed feelings about this game. It could have been very very good but has been let down by some very shoddy quality issues. This would not in itself have been a problem BUT given its AAA high price tag, to be honest, the consumer deserves better in terms of finish and execution. To name a few of the irritations:\n1.) AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n\n- I have an awfully hard love/hate relationship with this game. On one hand it's beautiful, has tons of awesome cars and can be really fun if played with friends. But it comes at a huge price - quite literally in Europe as it costs 69.99 € in contrast to 59.99 $ in the US. The correct price according to current exchange rates would be around 50 €, this is ridiculous. It's even worse if you remember that this game came out over 2 years ago and they still demand the same 99.99 € for the Ultimate Edition without any discount. \n\nApart from the pricing the game also has the worst support I ever encountered. My first ticket for a crashing game after release was answered 8 months later, my two more recent tickets about a translation error and a problem with the Forza Hub were both answered with \"yeah we know about this and are [i]investigating[/i]\" and were closed without fixing anything.\n\nLast but not least not offering the possibility to transfer a savegame after investing 300+ hours on the Microsoft Store version even if you use the same Microsoft account is such a bad move for veterans who were actually willing to pay the price again. \n\nAll in all I'm happy that MS made the move to Steam and I'm looking forward to the next Forza Motorsport release, but I'll skip this for now and I wouldn't recommend anyone to spend the full price on this game since you basically need to buy the Ultimate Edition for access to all available cars.\n\nBonus for those who are curious: It doesn't work on Linux with Steam Play right now and probably never will as it still completely relies on the Xbox infrastructure.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- I am over 50. \nI have played a lot of games.\nThe Return of the Obra Dinn is one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nIt is one of those rare cases (though certainly by design) where everything comes together.  Story, game play, graphics, challenge level, feeling of accomplishment on advancement. Simply an outstanding piece of work that I enjoyed every moment (even when frustrated) and will remember fondly.\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- I did not play this game, only the VR portion with a save game file I downloaded. I cannot stand third person over-the-shoulder cam games, and so I don't care about Ms. Tomb Raider. Frankly, after seeing her mansion, and hearing her stuck up voice, I kinda look upon her as a rich bitch, no matter how good she is at rock climbing.\n\nAs for the VR experience, it was pretty good overall, considering you can clearly tell it's a PSVR/PC thing, and so locomotion and playspace stuff is (almost necessarily) awkward. It's the Tomb Raider engine ported to Vr in a hot second, and overall it's fine technically. It's waaaay to damn dark though. I get that the manor is falling apart, and so the lights don't work, but it's just a waste of time to play VR experiences that are super dark. Well it's not dark, it's just very dim. IIRC I finished it but had to cheat, or maybe gave up just before the end and watched the conclusion on youtube. If you skip all the book readings and narration (as I did) it will be an hour of hunting and pecking around the castle for objects and secret doors. Not too shabby really. [spoiler]I'd have never gotten to this if not for the save game file though, phew.[/spoiler]\n- NPC's flying around like they are planes.\nNPC's driving around on invisible go-karts.\nBugged faces that are hideous and hilarious.\nArno likes sky diving through solid ground.\nACU.exe has stopped responding.\n\n11/10 Would buy again.\n- A dude looked at you funny? Punch him. Some guy is chilling by the river? Kick him in. A girl has a cute outfit on? Divekick her from across the street. Bought pizza at a food truck? Uppercut the staff. Violence is never the answer; It is in fact the question, and the answer is YES.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- I have only one point of criticism:\nThis game lacks a proper ending or epilog; something like The Witcher's Blood & Wine DLC. After adventuring hundreds of hours, after growing fond of and close to my companions, I got kicked so hard out of the game - it hurt!\nIn fact I immediately started a 2nd playthrough, because I wasn't yet ready to let go. Please Larian, give us an epilog or at least one last night at the camp with all my allies, companions and friends for the Definitive Edition.\n\nedit: As of patch5 this has been implemented. Thanks Larian Studios! You guys are the best!\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.\n- Like Fallout 4 but with karma,\nAnd reputation\nand ammo types\nand interesting factions\nand without half the npcs being essential\nand with interesting characters\nand good dlc\nand interesting companions\nand interesting world\nand cazadors\nand with more than 2 types of shotguns\nand with unique weapons actually meaning something\nand immersion\nand the ability to actually make your character how you want\nand with good skills\nand starting SPECIAL skills meaning something\nAnd actually being a solid 10/10\n- You are an astronaut, you wake up in a rescue rocket, and against your wills you are shot from Theseus space station on Chori V planet. After landing on the planet you find a strange device that helps you get back on board and survive until help arrives.\n\nGreat game, get it on sale, because it is a bit short. I like games like Portal 2, The Talos Principle, and there is no point to compare this games, because they are completly different, even if they have few common things like solving riddles and story with fresh look at some philosophical questions. Point is that every one of them including The Swapper is good at what it do, and every one of them is unique. For me it is pleasure to play this game beacause of it atmospheric well done design, riddles and questioning the meaning of existence.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- F2P update: Hey it's free now! STDs are free - avoid it.\n\nIt was great at the start, I put many hours into it. \n\nAaaand now it's aggressively monetised, forces all this microtransaction garbage on you, battle pass rubbish, skins, emotes, crates, more than one premium currency.\n\nAND they have the gall to ask £26.99 RRP for this? $30 to have the privilege of paying more money.\n\nMake it free at this point, you want to be Fortnite so bad.\n\nYou either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- I hold this game in as high esteem as games such as Undertale and Oneshot.\nIt would be a mistake to dismiss this game, as I once did.\n\nThis game made me really care about it. It's one of those games where the writing, music, graphics, and gameplay all work together to give life to the characters within it. Even though the setting takes place in a small area (comprising of 2 buildings, 3 caves, and a bake stand), it still feels like an entire world that had a past from before you started playing and a future that unfolds after you stop playing. Every part of the game serves towards this purpose. The developer took the time and effort to make sure every small, nuanced detail felt right. Whether it's a quirky little animation, the presence (or absence) of circumstance-fitting music, or the sound effects that make every footstep and enemy strike sound just right, this game does a phenomenal job making sure that every contributes an immersive experience. You’re not interacting with a piece of software, you’re interacting with a world.\n\nHowever, this game, as is all games, is not perfect. The combat can be a bit unintuitive owing to the fact that enemies can attack you while you are selecting your move, but you will PROBABLY get used to this and after that, boy, does it become quite an exciting experience. In addition, this game has many mentions of death. While this sounds terrible on paper, the game does manage to pull out some interesting game choices out of it. Unless you have trouble discerning fiction from reality (or are uncomfortable with the mention of death), you should be fine. All other flaws I won't elaborate on because they're subjective nitpicks (ex. didn't like a word choice; thought a certain sprite looked weird; thought that the music overplayed the \"spooky\" instruments that one time in the game).\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will make you invested in a new experience, you might have just found it.\n\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- In a world where \"enhanced edition\" has started to be synonymous with \"will run on modern hardware if you shell out $20\" it's absolutely refreshing to see Larian deliver this masterpiece free of charge to owners of the original. You start out with an already fantastic game that's received numerous game of the year and editor's choice awards. Then you spend a year polishing that game, and adding new features. The result is brilliant Enhanced Edtion of an already fantastic game.\n\nNew features for EE:\n[list]\n[*] Fully voice acted - Every line of dialog now has voice acting. The voice acting is really good too\n[*] Dual wield - Rogues now look more iconic with the ability to dual wield\n[*] Grenades - You can craft and throw various sorts of grenades. \n[*] Tactician Mode - A new  challenging mode where encounters are redesigned to be harder by adding new spells and enemies into the mix. Classic mode still available obviously.\n[*] Split screen co-op \n[*] Controller support\n[*] Updated graphics - The UI is totally reworked, the graphics are updated, and spells have new effects\n[*] Updates to the story  - The story, esepcially the ending, was rewritten a bit to clear up some confusing aspects\n[/list]\n\nI'm sure there's more, but really these ought to be reason enough to play this game.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Your girlfriend might be temporary but DOOM is ETERNAL!\n- Great game for the most part.\nI do not like how they made a rpg with twitch aspects though.\nMy characters are supposed to be strong and agile not me on the keyboard.\nDo not expect to beat the island master(2nd ending) unless your very agile with your fingers.\nAt 50 years old it is impossible to get him down past 3/4 health.\nToo much twich and not enough character skill.\nGames like might and magic you never had to be agile with the keyboard.\nGuess this one goes under my \"Ending too hard category\"\n- Gone are the days of mindless building and fun. Power grids? Taxes? Intense accounting and counter-intuitive path building. A pre-built zoo for tutorials. I actually felt MORE stressed after playing this game. If you're looking for something to flex that brain, perfect. If you're looking to release the cougars and create chaos, you can do that in sandbox I guess. You could also just not connect power grids correctly. Works like a charm. Honestly who thinks of these things\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- The good news is the driving physics, fuel and tire mechanics, and multiplayer design are the best the series has ever been. However, the overall package, performance, and presentation are significantly lacking in this game at launch. Unless you're desperate, hold off on purchasing this game until the developers have had time to put in additional content and fix the numerous bugs and the odd design choices they've made that I think may need to be changed. There's a lot of work that needs to be done on this game for it to be considered a complete racing game.\n \nThe performance on an 8700K+RTX4070 has been inconsistent at 1440p. While playing with frame rate unlocked at a mix of ultra and high settings I can get FPS into the high 80s but this is accompanied by regular drops of about 20 FPS so I felt it required the 60 FPS lock setting which was a bit disappointing. The other disappointment comes in how the game looks, which frankly is not visually pleasing even at the highest possible settings and generally just not a sharp enough picture no matter what you adjust.\n\nSo overall it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The racing itself is engaging and fun but the choices the developers have made with this game for presentation and functionality leave much to be desired. If it receives good post-launch support it may correct a lot of those issues but at launch it’s a bit disappointing and I do not recommend buying it.\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB. If you need a list of potentially distressing content in this game, feel free to PM me.\n- Loved the original, and this updated version is just as good.\n\nThe additions along the way are very nice, and the improved graphics are noticeable. \nBeing able to converse with your partners whenever you want is also amazing.\n\nHowever...\n\nWas disappointed to have a few areas and puzzles removed. Since those were the more difficult parts of the original game, I assume this was done for a more streamlined experience. \nInstead of your flower wilting to represent your life, it is now replaced by more accurate \"points\". Although this makes it easier to tell exactly how many hits you can take, I miss the more original old design.\nAn iconic music track was also changed, likely due to licensing issues...\n \nCan't completely replace the original for me, but it's still a very worthwhile experience! \nStill wishing for a sequel a decade later.\n- The EA anticheat successfully prevents players who aren't cheating from entering the game.\n- It's just generally speaking a very bad game, but it's an interesting tech demo to play for about 10-20 hours and experience the epic fail that it is. Therefore, if you can get this at 15 USD to see for yourself how Bethesda absolutely lost their edge, then you may not regret buying it at that price point.\n\nTrying to play the game seriously is extremely tedious. Fallout 4 is a good game in 2023, but this game is not. Modded Fallout 4 on Survival is way better.\n\nThis game should be called:\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Tedious Inventory Management Simulator\n\nI bought this for myself as well as a younger relative to impress him with the magic of Bethesda. He played it for 10 hours before cleverly throwing in the towel, while as a loyal fan I stuck it out a bit longer. I wasted about 200 USD on this absolute travesty of a Shit Simulator.\n- Death's Door - A Poem Review\n\nThere was a tale of a crow,\nWhose world was bleak and full of woe.\nUntil he stumbled across Death's Door,\nAnd realised after life there was much more.\n\nWith feathers preened, he began his quest.\nTo open this door he'd try his best.\nA sharpened beak and weapon in hand,\nHe ventured forth across the land.\n\nWhere first he came across a witch,\nWho really was an evil... hag.\nHer foes she turned into ceramic pots.\nAnd lives she ruined?

Take brawl stars for example their battle are like 5-8 minutes if that.\nAlso it isn’t really clear if I’m supposed to attack the other team or the creatures to get points toward the final score. And I think I was supposed to steal some loot but I don’t know how to do that either\nSo overall I feel I need a tutorial and some better graphics maybe closer to real life and not a blob of unruly colors.\n- tldr:\nits sniper elite 3,5.\nnot all that bad but then i look at good vs bad, bad wins.\nsince valve/steam still cant be bothered to implement a neutral thumb, its thumbs down from me.\nbuy it on sale if you must, not worth an AAA price tag for sure.\n\n--------\n\nsniper elite 4 is what sniper elite 3 should have been.\nthe maps are much bigger, the melee is far better/fluid, the xray cam is how you wanted it to be and it looks and feels overall pretty nice.\n\nso why didnt i like it, no thumbs up?\nbecause it also feels like its an update to sniper elite 3, nothing more and nothing new. at all.\nand there a re few things that really stuck out and which are just a big NONO:\n\n- the campaign is shockingly short. i read in someones review that they finished it in 6 hours. and i needed 10 or 11. disappointing\n\n- multiplayer is medicore.still.\nit feels half done; copied over from sniper elite 3; and i can never play more than 3 rounds before getting bored. \nand i dont think im alone because most of the time you find as average 3 lobbys for team deathmatch game types.\nbut multiplayer being multiplayer, everyone feels different about it so you may disregard this point if you wish.\n\n- the voice acting is one of the worst you will ever hear. the italian mobster you talk to sounds so bad that i literally started laughing.\nthe lady who gives you intructions via radio before each level sounds like someone working at a XXX hotline.\n\n- i have yet to encounter the high praised AI.\nthey are decent, yes, slightly better than sniper elite 3, on close and mid range... but if you actually manage to get to a high vantage point and snipe across the map, say 400,500m+? , (which is extremely rare btw), then the AI fails horribly.\nyou kill 2 people far away, the AI goes into alert and then calls the search off 5 seconds later because the game realizes you are far, far away and the alerted soldiers would need 5 minutes to get to you, kinda.\nso you can snipe at your hearts content, just wait every so often between shots.\ni have actually cleared an entire level that way. i didnt even move, never got spotted and no one ever knew where the shots came from. \nonce everything was dead, i just visited the objective checkpoints.\n\n- a sniping game that considers shots 100m+ \"Long Shots\" .\n... wut?\n\n- one of the things that bugs me most. dont let the big maps fool you. you only can ever go two ways, on one map 3.\nand finally it doesnt matter which way you go because you have to do all checkpoints anyway, which are both ways.\nthe majority of the map is covered with obstacles and terrain that can not be passed/traversed, forcing you on pre-determined paths.\nits a real themepark where you are forced to go where the developers want you to go. \nit becomes painfully obvious when there are high grass patches strategically placed along your way where the devs think that you should hide there because there you have an opportunity to stealth something for a bit.\nthere really is no freedom of choice when it comes to the map,how you approach things etc.\nall you can do is...left or right? and all guns blazing or try to stay semi-hidden.\nmeeh...\n\n- i remember watching a dev stream that introduced the game ,way before release. i already noticed a DLC button in their alpha client. i knew that was a bad sign...\nright after game release i found half of the items locked for DLCs that havent even been released yet.\ntake that plus very short campaign and below medicore multiplayer and you have zero reason to ever buy any DLC. \njust doesnt make any sense. \nwhy would you, what for?\n\n- releasing a game together with seperate dlcs the same day?\ni didnt expect that from rebellion.\nvery.shabby \n\nnow, having ranted like this....it is not a terrible game all together.\ni had fun while it lasted but it does not justify the price tag,ever.\nit could have been so much more but i guess greed and publisher pressure won at the end.\ni was looking forward to it and left disappointed.\n\nthe ending of the campaign already suggests there will be a sniper elite 5 but this time i shall wait until its on an 85% sale.\n- Fez is Phil Fish's stupendous indie tour-de-force, focussing on a little dude who learns to conquer the world of 3D! \n\nFez is incredibly addictive and pleasant to play. As Phil himself states in Indie Game: The Movie, it's a stop and smell the flowers kind of game. I spent 15 hours fully completing this game and loved every minute of it. Genuinely one of my favourite games ever. \n\nThere's puzzling, platforming and cute quirks everywhere. A wonderful and fun game for everyone. Wanna enjoy the experience even more? Watch Indie Game The Movie before playing and appreciate the amount of time and effort put into this wonderful creation.\n\n-Nilesy\n- First things first:\nYES, it has keyboard and mouse support.\nYES, you can use the Celestial Brush with the mouse.\nYES, you can skip any cutscenes and text without needing to complete the game first.\nYES, you can use a drawing tablet to play.\n[spoiler] NO, there is not the original song \"Reset\" in the entire game, be it from the end credits or the presents from Issun. [/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are.

REALLY well optimized, considering this computer is nearing the end of its life and the visuals are gorgeous.\n\nEDIT: 1080p :)\n\noh, and it's fun too, right.\n\nEdit 2- Actual review\n\nGame is pretty easy. I forget if there was a hard mode, but if there was I picked normal mode, and the game feels like it should be on easy. I've yet to break a sweat on a boss (currently chapter 5), and the only thing stopping me from taking on enemies 10+ higher than me is that the game auto-nerfs your damage if the enemy is too far above you. I've actually found the game very relaxing as a result, because there isn't the frustration of having to redo bosses after getting wiped, so it's not entirely a bad thing. But if you were looking for a challenge in your battles, this isn't your game.\n\nAs for story, it's also fairly basic, and rides off of having a sizeable to-do list as sidequests. Recruiting new citizens, doing major sidequest chains, unlocking new stuff, it's got a good amount to do in-game to keep you occupied, unless you're a \"main quest line only\" player. It helps that the warp system is easy to use (and you will use it often) and the game is gorgeous, so you don't really feel too bored doing the same shet over and over again. \n\nThere are several elements to the gameplay. \n\nOne, the overworld traversing. Overall, I'm ambivalent to it. It can feel slightly sluggish at parts, but collecting the shiny areas is surprisingly addicting (maybe because I'm a sem-completionist), as are finding chests. The unfortunate part is that most of these chests contain utterly useless items, so don't really feel that rewarding. \n\nTwo, dungeon crawling. Have to admit this is one of the weaker parts for me. The dungeons are basic, and don't really have much in the way of puzzling elements. Could change later, highly doubt it will. I do like how the battles are seamless, though.\n\nThree, army battles. Also not much of a fan of this, but only because it seems like a side addition without much depth to it. Fortunately it's not a major part of the game, so meh.\n\nFour, kingdom management. Holy cow I love this part of it. People might complain it feels like a mobile game with the wait times and whatever, but since you can warp straight back to your castle whenever you want, it's not that big of an issue. I do wish your gains accumulated while you're offline (or tabbed out, at least...), but idk something about managing the kingdom and making it grow/level up is stupidly addicting.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a challenging or engaging JRPG, this might not be the game for you. If you're looking for a game with gorgeous visuals, fantastic voice acting (using JP), laid-back atmosphere, and want to be the president of the United States serving some random kid as his vassal, highly recommended.\n\nHighly recommend to play on controller. I'm using the Switch Pro Con.\n- Yes, the Origin client is somewhere between annoying and broken, depending on your hardware. And yes, Dragon Age Keep is still a big jumble of poorly explained choices that affect your game in a thousand little ways if you choose to use it. And yeah, none of the old technical issues really got fixed before coming to steam - this isn't a remaster - so shiny hair and lips for everyone.\n\nBut it's nice to be able to take a walk in Thedas again, and sink into the story, and admire what is probably the last real Bioware game before EA completely turned them into another ouroboros of live service bullshit. \n\nGet it on sale, for the nostalgia if nothing else.\n- Mysterious, claustrophobic, and psychedelic --- this is undoubtedly the most unorthodox game in The Legend of Heroes series. This game is basically what you get when you put The Legend of Heroes, Shin Megami Tensei and a certain Silent Hill title [i](which I won't specify for a good reason)[/i] into a blender machine. Nonetheless, it is still very much an LoH game at its core, though its semi-fandisc nature holds it back from being as coherent of an overall package as its two predecessors.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: [b][u]If you were a big fan of the previous two games, you will not necessarily like this game; on the other hand, if you didn't hold them in high regard, this game is still worth trying out due to its stark contrast in tone and structure from its predecessors.[/u][/b] There is a good reason this game is named [u][b]\"the 3rd\"[/b][/u] instead of \"Third Chapter\", because it is definitely not a direct continuation of SC (i.e. Trails in the Sky Second Chapter).\n\nIf you want more of the upbeat, kingdom-trotting adventure of the previous two games, you're not going to find it here.\n\nIf you want towns full of vibrant NPCs, you're not going to find it here (at least not in the main story).\n\nIf you want a protagonist who wears their heart on their sleeves and acts like your typical spunky JRPG hero, you're not going to find it here.\n\nThis game is first and foremost [u][b]a gameplay-heavy dungeon crawler[/b][/u], one that is light on (main) story but carries some very heavy themes. The most interesting aspect of the game to me is that [i][b]the protagonist Kevin Graham is not a hero[/b][/i] (which is ironic considering the name of this series). This game is his harrowing personal journey, one in which he doesn't set out to save the world, his homeland, or anyone for that matter.\n\nThere are initially only two playable characters, but more and more join your party at a steady pace throughout the game [b](16 in total)[/b]. Be sure to talk to these characters when you swap them out of your party; they are ironically the only source of \"NPC dialogue\" for the majority of the game, and their dialogue updates after every plot point like in most other Falcom games. You know Falcom has done their NPCs justice in FC&SC when their complete absence here creates an uneasy sense of isolation.\n\nThere are visual-novel-like sidequests (called Memory Doors) which serve to further flesh out the characters and setting of this series, giving all the playable (and some non-playable) characters their own spotlight to shine in. To this day the cast of Trails in the Sky still remains my favorite cast of any RPG, and I have to give a good chunk of the credit to this game's characterization of them.\n\nThese sidequests take up a sizeable chunk of the game, which one might argue distract from the dungeon-crawling main game. Fortunately, they don't expire like in FC&SC and can be accessed at any point in the game before the final dungeon (with convenient fast-travel to boot), effectively enabling the player to pace the game themselves. \n\nWord of warning though, some of these sidequests take on a much darker tone than one would expect: there's a very good reason why the console versions of this game was censored [i](don't worry, the Steam version isn't)[/i]. Please be mentally prepared for the final sidequest you come across in the game, i.e. [spoiler]Star Door 15[/spoiler].\n\nThere is also plenty of foreshadowing for the rest of the series littered throughout the game, some obvious and some very subtle [i](I'm looking at you Mr. N)[/i]. Needless to say, this game gives you lots to think about if you are into the lore of this series, especially if you have played some of the later Trails games.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the soundtrack is widely regarded as the best in the trilogy?\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo end on a more critical note, I'd like to elucidate the \"semi-fandisc\" nature of this game:\n\nThere is severe disconnect between the main story and side content, with the latter adding nothing to the former for the most part; the sidequests are more of an anthology of supplementary material for the entire Trails series and are only tenuously tied to the main campaign, which by itself is sparse in story.\n\nThere is also an egregious amount of asset recycling from the previous two games. Although this is mostly justified within the context of the story, it's still vexing and makes the devs look lazy. They had the opportunity to add a lot of interesting new locales, especially those pertaining to Kevin and the church, but they chose not to for the majority of the game. Get ready to traverse through lots of familiar looking areas and dungeons...\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nP.S. Advice for 1st playthrough: If you are here mostly to enjoy the story, don't play on Hard; if you value your sanity as a gamer, don't play on Nightmare. Seriously, don't.\n\nP.S.2 When you first open up the game, don't skip the \"Falcom\" logo animation; just sit back and watch. There's a bit more after that.\n\nP.S.3 If you're really curious as to which Silent Hill title I was comparing this game to, potential spoilers if you are familiar with the SH franchise: [spoiler]Silent Hill 2[/spoiler]. Just how deep the similarities run between these two games, I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nP.S.4 A bit more on the censorship of this game: Falcom cut out large chunks of the aforementioned final sidequest when porting the 3rd from PC to the Sony consoles (PSP, PS3, and PSVita). They did this in order to keep the age rating consistent across the Sky trilogy; the PC version of the 3rd would undoubtedly have been rated \"M\" had it gone through ESRB.
